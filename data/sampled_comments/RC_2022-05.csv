"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","It costs many billions of dollars to run a foundry.  If you don’t have volume of scale, there’s no way you can afford to stay on the bleeding edge.   

The trick they used to use to follow moore’s law don’t work anymore.  We’ve hit fundamental limitations of physics. (See EUV).

So the foundries have to take wild risks to keep pressing forward. Not even intel is immune to making mistakes that make their foundries uncompetitive for multiple generations.  

Looking forward, it’s nano-sheets to replace fins, and power-via (backside power).  Every generation gets excessively more expensive, and it’s never a safe bet to assume that the costs of the next node will be competitive to the existing node.  

Running a foundry is a innovate-or-die treadmill of never ending  progress.",1651363200

"cinematography","t5_2ri38","I DPed two seasons of a show before I learned what was actually going on behind the scenes.  We interviewed people about things that had happened in their past.  Bad, awful, terrible terrible things that had happened to them or their family members.  We also shot recreations of the events they talked about.  I was unaware that the families we interviewed were not told about the recreations.  So when they watched the show they would suddenly be thrust right back into watching our recreations of the events.  I also was unaware that we approached these people and paid them.  I had thought they volunteered to tell these stories.  About 90% of these families were poor to very poor and the money we said we would pay them was enough to make them do it.  

I was crying in some of these interviews, a grown man, sitting behind a camera crying; not telling my wife the stories because I did not want her to hear them.  

So after two seasons of this mental torture of sitting through the stories, I learn 1. We are paying these poor (poor both economically and emotionally) people and 2. None are told of the recreations.  I learned this between season 2 and 3 and luckily was able to turn down season 3 for a much better, much more positive higher quality show.  But even if that other show hadn’t come along I would not have returned to DP another season.  I was mentally beat from listening to all these horrible stories and the ethics of paying poor people to tell these stories did not sit well with me and the fact we didn’t tell them about the recreations was unethical to me.  So I couldn’t continue to work on the show and have also not worked for that company since. 

It took a while for me to shake off the experience.  Luckily the show I did after season 2 was incredible and uplifting and helped get me past what I had experienced.",1651363200

"FreightBrokers","t5_32bkf","I rather go back and say my driver is not interested to take a load, than repost it on DAT, because people are aware of that, and they will check ofc, because of the previous experience and there you go, you lose contact (broker) in 10 minutes.

I ask for the info about the load manly to call up my drivers in the area so I know what Im offering them, commodity, rate, weight, PU and DEL times. If they ask for too much I will not even bother to tell the a rate to broker, I say that I cant cover it and maybe we can work on something else.

If I have a truck in hand, (If the driver called me for the load, and he is okay with the price) I give info right away so the broker can call the driver and speak with him, It is normal for me to connect calls so he can see that I have a driver for real haha.

Edit: ""If I have a truck in the hand"" to ""If I have a truck in hand"" No reason to put ""the"", haha.

"mead","t5_2rcsz","Really sharp alcohol taste is normal near the end of fermentation. A big part of “secondary” fermentation is just letting it sit—there’s often yeast still hanging around in suspension even after it looks like most of it became powdery stuff at the bottom, they’re still hanging out and digesting things, gasses are still working their way through—you just gotta let it “cool off”. Something that tastes like rocket fuel often mellows out by just letting it sit and giving it time.

Adding blackberries (or any fruit) is probably just going to restart fermentation unless you already got allll the yeast out. That’s why people said “back-sweetening”. That means adding sugar back into your juice to make it sweeter *after* your yeast fermented all the sugar you put in first into alcohol. The problem is that if you’re not careful, adding sugar back in just gives them more food and starts fermentation right back up again.

So if you want to flavor your mead with blackberries, read up advice on how fruit meads are made, how back-sweetening works, what you want to do with your mead when you move it to a secondary container and eventually bottle it. That’ll help you not to make bottle bombs that explode and hurt somebody under the pressure lol. If you just want that rocket fuel taste to go away, give it time, don’t expect it to taste perfect before you’ve even racked into secondary, and it should turn out just fine.",1651363200

It was one thing when being free was never known to the majority but we know what freedom is like to some degree and yet we still don’t seem to want that absolute freedom. Keep in mind slavery up until 1776 was pretty normal and it wasn’t until the “radical idea” of freedom for the masses was established where that changed. The US was founded on anti-European ideals especially slavery. Of course the founders believed the nation would split if they included it in the constitution so they opted for technology to out pace slavery and it almost did.

"pregnant","t5_2qwzb","I’ve worked from home since my son was 9 months. He’s two now. It works great for us. I know people like to talk about how impossible it is but I it depends on you, your child, and your job. My job knows I don’t have childcare. As long as my job gets done they’re fine with it. I’ve even gotten promotions. 
I honestly think my background prepped me better than many. Pre-pandemic I was the director at an after school program. I was responsible for all administrative duties and helping with childcare and customer service in per and on the phone in a room with 30 kids. The center had a total of almost 100 kids. I can balance a budget and hold a conversation about Pokémon at the same time, I can email on autopilot. So working from home is very much the same for me. My son gets a ton of attention and I still get my work done. He plays independently pretty well but I make myself available to play and take lots of mini breaks as well. My 8 hours still gets done. It just takes me a little longer sometimes lol. Once I’m off work my son gets my undivided attention. It’s hard some days but the benefits far outweigh the negatives. 
I have another one on the way in august. My oldest will start preschool around then. I want him to start getting some socialization with other kids. 
To each their own but I wouldn’t say it’s as impossible as the picture some people paint.",1651363201

That's always been part of the problem with the falcons organization... never gave ryan the offensive line he deserved the one year we had a system that was perfect for his playstyle we went to the superbowl and instead if sticking with that pattern it only lasted two years.

Like I said in another post on here a second ago. We gave had elite players and pretty good coaches here and still cant win.. so most of the problems come from the front office / ownership thinking fancy stadiums and shit are a fix but the only fix is doing everything you can to win.

[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Trans_Resources/wiki/hormones/transfeminine/index#wiki_injections) was a brochure by Fenway detailing sites.

And if you can, having a number of values tested may be a good idea. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Trans_Resources/wiki/hormones/transfeminine/index#wiki_testing) may be more. There may be private labs in case, or there may be supportive med persons, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/TransDIY/wiki/index#wiki_blood_tests) was more.

And some people reported reduced efficiency with air transport. It may be necessary to have a few tests though to find out if this is the case. Uptake can vary from shot to shot, there were studies showing a wide variation.

In general insensitivity may be very unlikely. Unlike AIS ( androgen insensitivity syndrom ) it would be much more rare.

"horror","t5_2qh9x","Most found footage films are pure gimmick and would be better served by traditional cinematic techniques. Blair Witch worked for a variety of reasons: it was smartly made, the ad campaign was phenomenal, and, while it is not the first found footage film it has elements of First In, Best Dressed in that it is the first to find the type of success it did. BW's success spawn a slew of movies that tried to be the next BW. 

This isn't to say that there's no place for found footage, even though I dislike it for the most part, I recognize that some stories are better told through the lens of found footage. Rather, because it is treated as a pseudo-genre I think the convention, or the gimmick, is leaned on at the expense of doing something interesting with the story. It always comes across to me as being the same camp as 3D. There are some films that do 3D well, and then there are those films that have 3D elements that are obviously tacked on and that feel cheesy and artificial.",1651363203

"goodanimemes","t5_2y4au1","I am a hungarian and I really love my language. After studying multiple languages on a surfice level (japaneese, russian, german) and studying english to a fluent level I can say that hungarian is really beautiful. Hungrian gives the most freedom to express yourself of any language I know. You can use words in pretty much any order and any context. It also almost always makes sense, we only have a small amount of convention in our language so most language constructs play by the rules. Hungarian can express all kinds of poems with rhymes, emphasis and timeing. The language is finno-ugoric (well there is some debate but that seems like the consensus) but it also has an uncanny similarity to latin in how it sounds. We used to also have our own alphabet but almost nobody can read it now, tough some towns names are still displayed with that alphabet next to the latin alphabet version. I have been told that my accent sound similar to a sweedish accent and after speaking with some swedes I can definitely hear it, very fascinating.",1651363203

Later in evolutionary history, there were predatory ungulates (same group goats belong to), like hyaenodon, which looked like a wolf with a huge head. Just a unique take on wolves that would be cool.  

During the Ice Age, North America had giant ground sloths like Megatherium. They were slow and probably stupid, but they were absolutely massive and had claws that they used to carve caves for themselves out of solid rock. Great as a scary animal to have on the outskirts of some town.

"Racket","t5_2rjn1","Tree Accumulation is not a term I've heard used when talking about either normalization or evaluation. Both normalization and evaluation can be thought of as operations on trees, but neither one has an operation specifically called Tree Accumulation.

""Normal order"" is a reduction strategy for the lambda calculus --- that is, a strategy for selecting the next candidate beta (β) or eta (η) redex to reduce. It has the nice property that it finds a normal form if one exists. But ""finding a normal form"" is not the same as ""evaluation"".

""Applicative order"" is a confused term that some people use for call-by-value evaluation. It isn't a strategy for choosing between candidate redexes; it changes the set of candidate redexes entirely. For the lambda calculus, it means that the calculus uses beta-value (βᵥ) instead of beta (β) reduction.",1651363204

[**Credit For This Recipe Goes To Sonja &amp; Alex**](https://www.acouplecooks.com/vegan-sloppy-joes/)

Serves 8

**Ingredients**

* 2 cups brown or green lentils
* 1 quart vegetable broth, divided
* 1 teaspoon kosher salt, divided
* 1/2 green bell pepper (about ¾ cup diced)
* 1 medium onion (about 1 cup diced)
* 4 garlic cloves
* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons organic ketchup, divided\*
* 2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon vegan Worcestershire sauce, divided (or use this substitute)
* 1 teaspoon each mustard powder, onion powder, and chili powder
* Hot sauce, to taste
* Pickled onions, to serve
* Bread and butter pickles, to serve
* 8 whole wheat buns (make sure they are vegan, use gluten-free as desired)

**Instructions**

1. **Cook the lentils:** In a large saucepan, place the lentils with 3 cups of the vegetable broth, 2 cups water, and ½ teaspoon kosher salt. 
2. Bring to a rapid simmer. Reduce the heat and simmer uncovered for about 20 to 25 minutes, until the lentils are tender but still hold their shape (start tasting at 15 minutes; the exact timing depends on the heat level and your pan size). Drain the excess liquid.
3. **Meanwhile, make the sauce:** Once you’ve started the lentils, dice the bell pepper. Dice the onion. Mince the garlic.
4. In another large saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium high heat. Add the bell pepper and onion and cook 5 minutes until the onions are translucent. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute. 
5. Add vegetable broth, 1 cup ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, mustard powder, onion powder, and chili powder. Simmer for 5 minutes until thickened.
6. **Add the lentils to the sauce:** When the lentils are done, add them to the sauce. Cook on low heat for about 5 minutes. 
7. Then remove the heat and stir in the remaining 2 tablespoons ketchup, 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce, and ½ teaspoon kosher salt. 
8. **Serve:** Serve on a bun with pickled onions and pickles. (If desired, toast the buns prior to serving.) Make ahead: Leftovers save well for 3 to 4 days. 
9. Make in advance, refrigerate and then reheat in a saucepan. Add an extra squeeze of ketchup if it seems dry.",1651363204
"DaveRamsey","t5_2qjeq","I second the Bogleheads approach for investing. I tend to put most of my money into S&amp;P500 index fund and some in an International index fund and some in an extended market index fund. That’s pretty much it. 

As for having extra to give and spend on yourself and save, once your mortgage payment is done make sure you are setting aside the proper amount for taxes and homeowners insurance. After that, the rest of the mortgage payment is now extra wealth. 

Look up the 3% or 4% withdrawal rule, and save up enough to retire and draw down that much per year. It will give you a handy rule of thumb to know when you’re financially free to retire. 

Make sure you have all your insurances in place: mainly Life Insurance and Umbrella Insurance

"lookismcomic","t5_3mdns","I both agree and disagree.

Yes, UI Daniel is using his moves optimally but there is also a difference of refinement between a copycat like Johan or small Daniel and UI.

There are two good examples that show that difference.

First one is when Johan uses taekwondo copied from Taehun to fight Vasco. Normally Johan is strong and fast enough to oneshot Vasco before he even blinks but using only TKD Johan was about equal to Vasco. Why? There is the difference of refinement between different moves Johan copied. He didn't yet get used to the new moves so they weren't as strong as his other techniques.

Second example is when Daniel tries to use the beyblade move against Cap Guy and misses. The reason he missed was because he saw the kick hit Jake instead of Jerry who the intended target. Daniel copied the move that hit the guy right in front of the intended target so he messed it up.

UI on the other hand has every move perfectly refined. Every technique is as precise and well executed as possible.

Also it isn't a straight, it's 1 inch punch.",1651363205

"Bumble","t5_3531l","Of course! And that's nothing but a good thing :) 

The question is how to go after it and if the approach you're using is working. Most people are putting in plenty of effort, but the way they're going about it guarantees lackluster results. 

Most men want to pursue and most women want to be pursued. It just feels better for most of us. You know? 

If what you want is to be with a man who pursues you, then you're much better off finding ways to present him with attractive opportunities to pursue you than with you pursuing him and him going along with it for a single soccer game.

There are a bunch of reasons it feels better that way, but one reason for men is that a little challenge causes our testosterone levels to rise, and that makes us feel awesome. 

So if you're doing all the pursuing rather than giving him fun challenges to overcome to get to you, that can easily become a reason he doesn't get that rush from being around you that would make him want to keep coming after you. 

Making this changeover can be awkward and frustrating. It will take experimenting and often can lead to an even drier drought for a while, because while you figure out a new way of attracting men rather than pursuing them, you won't even be having those single fruitless soccer games with guys. 

But I promise it's worth it. It's not about the results you're going to see next weekend or next month. It's a long term goal of becoming a powerful and irresistible woman that men will GLADLY climb over mountains to pursue :)",1651363204

"newzealand","t5_2qhma","I don’t have a simple solution that I can summarize in a reddit comment because this is a complex and nuanced issue requiring more than glib answers.

I think the best tools are the ones we are already using. Utilizing the fundamental values of liberalism and democracy to push for rights, representation and justice for all people in Aotearoa/NZ.

What happened in early colonization was wrong. It should not have happened but it did so now we have to address the inequity. I don't think we can do that by rolling back the clock without causing deep harm to our unity as a nation. We have made huge strides as a country since 1980. I believe that if we can continue to encourage the country to understand ourselves as people with a duty to grow and nourish our heritage then we will continue to make more progress.

So in brief - Maori led initiatives for social issues affecting Maori. Te reo and cultural education for all NZers and a continuing push to keep building on the progress we have made so far. 

Its slow. Its frustrating. Its not flashy but it will get up further and to a better place than policies that divide us.",1651363205

"houseplants","t5_2skiq","It comes down to personal choice and also different additional reasons - I’ll try to cover  them completely since any one of them alone is not necessarily super compelling. 

The main one is: I cannot live like this inside my home, it causes me discomfort, distress and uneasiness. It is always on my mind whenever I have any infestation indoors regardless of their harm or benefit. The other is more of a matter of principle: I have grown plants without them for 3 years - I cannot let an infested bag of soil decide for me if my house is now a home to insects (* though not technically insects). Maybe it’s my neuroses.. ? 🤷‍♀️ 

I am all for them living in the garden or large potted plants outside (maybe even very large potted plant indoors? not sure). Happy to have them doing their thing. But, I have no outdoor area, it is all indoors. I have many plants. Majority of the containers are between 3 and 6 inches so just bare minimum sizes without being severely root bound (less soil for them, more roots and expanding scavenger hunt opportunities). Springtails reproduce at prolific rates. Outdoors they have predators that indoors do not exist - I am the predator, the only one available here 🙂. Some kinds are known to start nibbling on young plant roots as well - in small containers, indoors, in optimal breeding conditions, it’s much more likely to happen (maybe this kind isn’t it never would, but, I don’t know.. I rather not wait to find out). There is simply not enough of a complete ecosystem to naturally manage an ever increasing population which has a potential of venturing out to find other food sources/dwellings (sinks maybe?). 

While overall they are certainly beneficial, these are all the reasons why I personally simply cannot opt in to keep them indoors.",1651363205

Most people who have a plan hide it really well. 

Moreover, if someone wants to do that, nothing will stop them. You may delay them, but if they’re really bad off- nothing you can say will stop them.


 I had a friend of mine hang herself a few years back. For the longest time I kept thinking “what if I had texted her, could I have stopped her? Did I miss the signs?” When in reality some of the shit she’d lived through? Nothing I could have done would have stopped her. Nothing. She waited until her husband went to bed and made sure he’d had a couple drinks so he was completely out, and then… did it.  Like I knew she was severely depressed. But I didn’t think she’d do it. Like we even had plans to visit each other that summer. - usually when someone has long term plans… they’re not gonna do it

Pederson was an bad defensive OF with a 90 OPS+, Soler was arguably the worst player in all of baseball, and Rosario was bad defensively, injured, and had an 86 OPS+ when healthy. They all randomly went off for half a season, but 2/3 suck again. 

Both teams got a bunch of replacement level players, and the Cardinals still won more games. Unless the Braves knew that all of those guys would excel, I’m not sure why they should get more credit. Those guys randomly having great playoff runs doesn’t make the process any better, it’s just luck.",1651363206

The series follows Two agents from the ATF as they track illegal drug in firearm sales. The couple is great, and the plot is just as good. Each book covers a different case with over arching villain throughout. Has a solid HEA. I believe the two guys were vers  if I remember correctly. They do go through some bad stuff but it’s nothing so terrible they can’t come back from it, and you get a lot of hurt comfort because of it. I don’t remember the sex scenes that much which makes me feel like they probably aren’t anything too crazy but it has been a couple years. I’ll post again if I think of anything else.",1651363207

"obs","t5_2wfse","not the bridge itself, the bridge is our ""air gap"" for the sync issue.

anyhting recording/grabbing frames will introduce lag because the system has to deliver twice and wait for it to be done with it.  


however its about the same lag as OBS just running without any transcoding.  
reason is because ndi is not doing any scaling, and doing a lot less transcoding (thats why ndi streams need so much bandwidth) 

so we only get the screen grabbing lag, but we spare ourself the added latency from transcoding. this is done via bridge.  


so for direct x the hole process is done once the bridge recieves it. just a memory thing. even tough in reality that frame is still in work elsewhere but we dont care.  


as for apex specific (or any other game that runs on linux/steam) best way todo it is linux via nvfbc driver hack and (sadly only on linux) obs plugin for nvfbc.  


with the right settings almost zero even less lag than ndi. there is still something there but mostly acceptable even on a high level.

however audiosetup and vban is a mess. took me over a week to have it halfway running but the hesuvi replacement (needed for custom HRIR) is meh",1651363208

Now THAT is a Brian Wilson homage song. What a cool record, thanks.

Yep, haha. That pre chorus little chord progression (bow bow bow bow bow bow bow bow)

&gt;Apparently Todd Rundgren is a fan of wall of sound and used it as a producer for Meat Loaf's Bat Out of Hell album, Bonnie Rait's Total Eclipse of the Heart.

Had no idea. Tundgren is only recently on my radar so I didn't know he was a producer and stuff. I've always passionately loved Total Eclipse of the Heart lol. 

&gt;Sometime in the late 80's and 90's the term sort of morphed into having a lot of sound (rather than all being recorded live in studio with multiple mics).

Yeah I agree. Sometimes the way ""wall of sound"" is used makes me strongly suspect it's not really understood what was going on with the sound. I think I just became known as a synonym for lush instrumentation, Long Winding Road etc.

Busta really ads to this, but also wish there was a bit more to ad to the second half

---

**Neighbourly** (10): one of the best beat switches I've ever heard and killer verse from consequence, easily keeping up with busta is no mean feat. Good control not making this song longer than it needed to be.

**TheRealRemyClayden** (10): Consequence killed it, and the beat…jeez. And this is basically the Tribe B team lol

**deckmemer** (9): the beat switch nice as fuck

**EarthTurn** (8): Mobius Fever is sweeping the nation

**team\_kockroach** (7.9): Consequence’s verse is a little off-topic and Busta’s energy doesn’t gel well (even if he’s very entertaining)

**XmasCarolusLinnaeous** (7.5): damn ok this beat's sick too

**seanderlust** (7.3): it's a good song, but the switch up between consequence's flow and busta's all-caps style here is a little jarring lol

**flyestshit** (6.5): Busta Rhymes really makes the Consequence verse seem like a mere lay-up. Bus absolutely killed this.",1651363212

Let's take as an example the May 20 AMZN call at 2460: the evening of May 20, if a share of AMZN is worth more than 2460, every person who has a positive number of contracts will exercise their contracts. The morning of May 21, if you add up all the gains and losses of every person who ever held the 2460 call, the sum will be zero. Every dollar made came directly out of another participant's pocket. Fundamentally these derivatives are just contracts betting on the underlying.

This is in contrast to actual shares where you are buying an ownership stake in a company that engages in some kind of business. There are no counterparties (barring whatever voodoo share creation might happen with some shorting). Some businesses are profitable and will issue you a dividend. Someday you might vote to replace the board of directors to make a company more valuable. Because the company generates real value by producing goods and services(hopefully), it is quite possible that you can add up all the gains and losses from every person that has ever held a share and get a very positive sum, even a sum much greater than the current market cap (see AT&amp;T for one example). There have been many companies that ultimately go bankrupt or are acquired for less per share than some paid, but they still generated more dividends for investors than they ever took in through investments.",1651363214

"DnD","t5_2r9ei","I am incredibly confused as to why so many people are suggesting “beard shaving” as an appropriate war crime to justify public hanging/flayings. Like, yeah, Dwarves classically care a lot about their beards, but humiliating someone by removing a culturally significant body styling is sill extremely far removed from, you know, public executions.

Anyways, here are my thoughts for some Elvish atrocities, mostly playing off the stereotype that Elves have access to powerful magic, and the idea that the “punishments” being used by the Dwarves are in some way symbolic of the warcrimes that were committed:

- Since the Elves are being publicly hanged, it seems like it would be fitting if they used some form of asphyxiation while fighting the Dwarves like poisoning the air in mines or magically decaying equipment until rust fills people’s lungs.
- You mentioned flaying the bodies of the Elves, so perhaps they used something like a mass “Heat Metal” spell to sear the skin off of Dwarfish armies, or animated entire thickets of bramble to horrifically slice through the occupants of rebellious towns/cities.
-Since the Elf bodies are left to rot in the square, perhaps Dwarves were either unable to bury their dead in the war, or were forced to be around corpses for prolonged periods of time. Maybe the Elves used mass graves to dispose of the groups they slaughtered, or would use necromancy to animate defeated combatants, not only forcing other Dwarves to fight their fallen comrades, but also incentivizing that they cremate their dead instead doing whatever burial rights are normally performed.

Idk if these crimes are meant to have actually taken place or if they are just supposed to be excuses the Dwarves came up with to further oppress the Elves, but thats about all I came up with on the matter.",1651363215

His behavior concerns me, and it's not just the exorbitant amount being ""asked"" for here. You've said in other comments that your finances are mostly separate, and that he pays ""rent"" to live in the house legally owned by your son.

I wanted to ask: do you find that you are paying the bill for these activities more often than he? Is the burden truly shared equally, or does it default to you? Is the house that you both live in similar to one he could afford on his own, or is it larger/nicer/in a better neighborhood? Is the lifestyle that he currently enjoys mostly down to being with you (ie, living in your house; being able to use your boat, country club membership, etc), or does he find it himself?

"AmItheAsshole","t5_2xhvq","You're leaving your wife to carry the mental load. 

This stage is all about pre gaming. Now you can look, find the best deals and shop and compare. How will you know what is safe if you aren't looking? It's not also about what is safe, but what is functioning for you as a parent. 

When we were looking at baby tubs, I was fine without one. It was not my first rodeo and it wasn't necessary. But my husband was worried about managing a new baby in the bath. So we found one that had a mesh sling and was adjustable for different stages which made him comfortable to do baths. 

Same with swaddles. We adjusted and got ones with Velcro straps so he could be comfortable doing changes at night. 

Car seats have so many options. There are sets that work with strollers so you just drop that in, there is pram options, do you want a jogging stroller stroller or 4 wheel stroller, can you comfortably out the seat and stroller into your vehicle? 

Let me tell you everything you buy for baby has an option. Right down to burp cloths. The list you need for baby items is long. You really need to be involved.",1651363216

"ActionFigures","t5_2scrt","I also removed all my figures from their boxes, but didn't customize any because I tought about maybe selling them later.

Since my collection only has 14 figures, I think it's worth it. I mean, I am not selling any Marvel figure, as I still want to have a lot of those. But collecting DC and Star Wars on 1/12 is really troublesome and quite expensive (I am not from the US, so Hasbro only sends ML here officially, which makes all their other brands cost almost the same as an SHF), while DC I can only get a good figure through Mafex or Mezco, and those already cost 1/3 of a Hot Toys.

I am thinking about doing this (and switching to 1/6 for both DC and Star Wars) because I realized 2 things:

First, my collection is really small, so I would rather get one better figure that I can see from afar, than 6/7 figures that I can only enjoy by getting really close.

Second, I realized that I don't want everything that I thought I wanted. For DC I thought that I wanted a huge shelf with all the characters at first, but the difficulty on finding good 1/12 DC figures that scale well with each other (Mezco is usually quite bigger than Mafex and Figuarts), made me realize that I am going to be really happy with just the 7 main JL. Same thing with Star Wars.

And since I realized that I don't want a lot of figures from those brands, I am wanting the best possible version of them that I can get. I mean, If I am to have 5 BS figures on a single shelf and 2 DC figures on another, I would rather trade them for one that's way better. I don't know If that made sense, but that's what I am thinking.",1651363216

Job application

Inbox

After weeks of consideration we have decided to

go with another candidate who is better suited to

our needs at this time.

It was noted during your interviews, you told both

our recruiter and the hiring manager that ""they

wasted your time because they were late"" and ""you

took time off from work just to hear a low ball offer

and that we should have posted the salary range in

the job description"" We told you that we do this so

people won't apply just for the money. After which

you replied ""what money?""

Thank you for your time and consideration.

"ukvisa","t5_32gvi","&gt; Is it possible to keep my passport while awaiting for a visa decision

Yes, for 90 €.

https://pos.tlscontact.com/par_en/added-value-services

Make sure to add that service when you first apply.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; so I can travel to the UK? Am I going to [be allowed] at the border?

* If the e-passport gates are available and operational when you arrive and do not refer you to speak with a Border Force officer, then quite possibly yes

* If you need to speak with a Border Force officer, and the officer sees that you have already stayed a long time in the UK and will be staying for another long time, and that you have long-term plans to live in the UK, so that you might be perceived as not a visitor anymore, then possibly no, but possibly yes. At that point, your answers and the documents you have about your stay, your plans, your work and income, your plans to travel back to France like to receive your visa, etc, become relevant.

* If you instead enter the Common Travel Area through the Republic of Ireland, especially if the egates at Dublin Airport are available and operational, do some light tourism in the RoI, and then continue to Northern Ireland and then to Great Britain, then quite possibly yes

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; I'm travelling from France.

Are you a French national? If so, were you physically present in the UK at any point between March 2019 and December 2020? If yes, have you considered an application for EUSS instead of a spouse visa, and potentially saving roughly £10,000?",1651363217

"guam","t5_2qx3l","&gt;Not a statement of blame, but it is a fact.

Totally. The federal system knowing that they're taking advantage of GovGuam and GovGuam is proudly milking it. But I feel like it could've been worded better, then I probably wouldn't have taken a stronger stance on it. 

I just sympathize with workers who can't be at fault. Like where I currently live in Seattle, a bunch of tech workers gets so much hate for moving here because they work for big tech companies. And yes, it is a fact that them moving here causes a huge problem with the housing market, but they aren't the problem. It's the big companies that drives these demands up and the government isn't doing anything to help solve that issues. Same with the DOD and Guam. 

The local and federal government are a sham. It is important for people to know who they are electing but that is a different subject to talk about. 

I hope whatever I'm saying doesn't offend you. I'm constantly learning new things everyday and hearing from different perspectives help me grow as well.",1651363218

Ghost is a dark horse though. They have looked very good against everyone but the reigning champs. The only teams to look good against G2 recently have been Queso, and BDS. 

SSG lost to G2 with the same(similar?) series score their last official match. So this should be a good game. I think SSG’s got the ice and ghost will break under the pressure. Ghost will also get danieled. 

Faze vs SSG rematch is going to be an absolute banger. I truly hope this happens.

"interactivebrokers","t5_339ag","The post in case deleted:  

&gt;I am writing this post to let you know the recent experience when I tried to short CVNA in my accounts. In short, this is not a firm worth staying. I know it offers cheap pricing, international access and some good trading tools, but trust me, it is better to use the best part of the firm, and maybe do some other things at other brokers.  
The problem with IB is that in order to protect themselves, they made up their own rules regardless how their clients are feeling. And their inadequate investment into customer service resulted bad service, rude people and overall lack of confidence of clients. A friend told me before, I did not take it seriously and was hurt recently as a result.  
I started to short CVNA at 120. It was a little position. When I learned all the facts and decided to bet big, the problem surfaced. First, there is a concentration rule at IB, meaning that after a threshold unknown to human beings and only known to the machines, they are gonna pose a high margin on your short position. I did not know this so I called. It took 40 mins to get through. Once all the questions were answered, the phone was hung off like I was a plague. In the end, I was only able to short half the shares I wanted, you can tell how much potential profit lost. But limiting concentration in this case does make sense because it protects both clients and brokers. So I decided to let it pass.  
Then two things happened. As the share price went down dramatically, I found out that IB does not release the initial margin. I sold all my positions in order to put up shorts. Let's say I have 1 million in NAV and I shorted only 40% of that and with 1.4 million in total cash, which happened in this case, the client and broker should be safe in a stock trading 10 million shares a day right? Now the price went down 20%, and I have 1.08 million in equity and 320k in short positions, I still do not get any margin released. This is a arbitrary rule posted by that against any common sense.  
The second thing is even more absurd. I bought some short-term puts, fully paid. Little did I knew, those puts were considered a short position and was imposed a 110% margin as well! So when the puts' value rose dramatically I kept getting margin calls and was forced to liquidate. Can you believe this? I thought this only happens in the wonderland. Of course, there might be someone who knows better about it so please explain to me how this makes sense.  
The problem with IB is that they think the machine is going to make them rich. It used to be good because lots of geeks were on the platform and they like the way it worked. However, as it is transforming from a broker relying on commissions to an asset gatherer on earning spreads, this will hurt their customers like me because there is no way to know what kind of rules they are going to impose to protect them from losing a million here and there while earning billions in profit a year. This is not the way to operate a business on a scale.  
My suggestion is that to leave something on the platform. Long only. Best pricing, best execution and international access. Move all the money out if you do not need them and find somewhere more friendly to park the cash.",1651363219

Rhaena's own hand extended out to lay gently on Andrik's, as she nodded. ""I do care to. In Lys, I put much time into practicing such things. To not utilise such things... would be a waste.

[PSA: Fix for Vive Wireless Crashes (Confirmed working with 3 users already)](/r/Vive/comments/ufnf45/psa_fix_for_vive_wireless_crashes_confirmed/) by  ViveJesus


Tired of your Wi-Gig module crashing and ripping you out of VR? Fix it with this one simple trick! (vive devs hate that!) . Start by searching ""services"" in the windows pane.. Open the services app and find the ""Vive Runtime Service"". Next change the startup type to ""Manual"" and stop the service. every time you start VR, you will get a popup for vive to ""Make changes to your device"".. but this is a small price to pay!

The most of force I have to apply for the mouse to go from one end to the other is very low. I love speed pads, they are my favorite and AC2 is one of my favorite speed pads.

Dataiku is a software startup. They have a product that helps data scientists create ""AI"" models more quickly and efficiently. Data scientists are essentially nerds that love math, data, and programming. And the insights they generate for their companies can make a lot of money, so there is a lot of demand for products like Dataiku makes.

But here's the deal, none of these Dataiku-like products have their own data. You have to go out and get it and then import it into the tool somehow. So don't worry about them trying to grab lots of data.

In this light, the creepy ad/haiku doesn't sound that bad. It's just data people trying to inspire data people (mostly to buy their product).

""Governance"" isn't creepy. It's actually *anti*\-creepy. Governance is the function within companies that restricts them from acting outside of their own policies. It's your friend. Enron had notorious governance failures, for example. 

I suspect you're of the opinion that AI has advanced far beyond where it is. Despite all the hype about ""artificial intelligence,"" 99% of it is helping people understand data better (e.g. finding new ways to make money in the markets, diagnosing illness, figuring out whether to give someone a bank loan). The other 1% is very exploratory.

And none of it gets anywhere close to what AI is like in the movies.

It's a fascinating field, and a very promising one.",1651363220

If it's not the character might just try a single roll if time is an issue or might stop for a couple minutes to use the ""take 20"" option.

*Edmund Rumpler was one such engineer who built “Rumpler Tropfenwagen” in 1922. He was the first person to conduct wind tunnel experiments on cars. this car had drag three times lower than other cars of that day. The most influential designer of this era was Paul Jaray, who was originally a zeppelin airship designer. He designed cars with smooth body surfaces, integrated fenders and headlights, cambered windshields and other innovations. This design was eventually copied by BMW, Audi, VW and others.*",1651363221

i believe it's 900p 120fps (if 120hz capable display) or 1440p 30fps.

the one x gpu is a LOT stronger, i believe on par with series x. bad part about the one x though is lack of ssd so it's shit load times and a terrible cpu. 

i think series s gpu is a low end gpu in pc terms, which sounds bad. the saving grace is fsr 2.0 if devs use it in their games. myst was able to target 60fps with 1440p

the real confusing part is if the fps drops were just down to bad optimization (btw if you haven't, myst remake is pretty nice and chill game).

"dryalcoholics","t5_39pn6","Happy birthday! And congratulations on 3 years sober. Sobriety could never last longer than maybe a week or so for me because I always thought ""what's the point?"". Was there ever a point where sobriety was novel and exciting to you? I know that without some sort of substitute (and by that I don't mean any sort of mind-altering drug) I wouldn't have also made it to 3 years this past Friday. For me it was AA and I needed it. Some people don't and can stay sober without having to really change their life like that which AA provides. But making some changes in your life might help with feeling like you're missing out on life because you're not drinking. I still have some old friends that drink and take gummies every night but I don't hang out with them when they're just at home doing that stuff, and my patterns of people that I hang out with and what I do with my time is vastly different (i.e., I don't really spend time in bars unless I'm playing out with my band, don't feel the need to stay places if I don't feel like being there, don't feel the need to explain myself to people who ask me if I want a drink). 

Are there any causes or things you strongly believe in that you can get behind to give you a sense of purpose? For some it's building a career, or starting/building a family, or traveling, or volunteering, or getting involved in religion or their church, or going back to school for something they've always wanted to do. Hell I'm excited to just have some time off and burn through some of the books that are sitting around waiting to be read. 

I know that I drank just to be okay with living. Just existing on the planet was a hassle and a chore once sober. Find your thing that gives you some okay-ness with living your day-to-day life. And know that nobody on this planet has it figured out.",1651363223

"prolife","t5_2qscv","I do believe that killing a person in a coma is wrong, I really do. 

And it's actually a very interesting question since I am aware there is an entire debate right now about the withdrawal of all nourishment and hydration from a patient who had suffered severe brain damage as a result of a cardiorespiratory arrest to be as an unlawful killing. And it might be a shocker especially regarding my pro-choice position but I do view it as murder.

In the same way, of course killing someone who is sleeping is murder too. I am going from the extreme part of the consciousness scale (brain dead or the equivalent of the earliest stage of brain development of a fetus) to someone who is on the least unconscious scale (sleeping.). 

Extremes are never really good to consider but there is still an intrinsically logic to follow- of course parts of that scale can be use to measure life in itself, not physically what consists as life but more philosophically and everything that makes us really us.

And yes, I am aware of the other side of the debate: the absolute right to life intrinsically and almost in a sacred way. I am not trying to start a debate about life and death and the right to live or die. This is maybe outside of the subject but I live pretty close to Switzerland where an entire debate is going on about the right to die in dignity and cutting off the resources of brain dead people who are totally supported by hospitals help and are basically in a vegetative state. Again, there is this question of personhood and what defines a human and it's life.

Does the unborn child takes part of the entire woman's body, I would say yes. Even if it's not entirely direct, there is still that indirect action that is lead because of it's existence. 

The heart must increase in size to accommodate extra blood flow. Blood volume increases as much as 50% to help supply enough oxygen to the growing demands of pregnancy. Your pulse rate will raise. It doesn't take as much to digest after we eat as it is to house an entire fetus. Even your blood pressure will generally decrease.

Even in the case of a pro-choice debate I am still sometimes completely shocked to hear people belittle pregnancy to a matter of convenience. It is natural from a woman's body, but natural doesn't mean easy or without risks or pain. It's not a mere discomfort as women we can and sometimes die from it.

Very stupid argument but for exemple: your feet are not supposed to be used, yet they still swell, your entire body is heavier to the point where your back hurts like hell. It can even wake years of nerve damages in your back for the worst.

But yeah, as much as pregnancy doesn't violate by essence a woman as it is her nature, knowing what pregnancy entails, the danger, the pain, the trauma that even years after are still there physically and mentally (no joke, giving birth can literally gives you PTSD), it's not temporary at all. Now, having an abortion and yes, ending something forever, and not having the right to end a pregnancy but having to go through it, knowing what could happen to you physically and mentally, which one is the lesser of two evil truly.

When I entered the abortion debate, there was also this part of me that sometimes begged people -and yeah especially men- to understand that no women liked having an abortion but often they really really needed one. And when they absolutely, for whatever reason needed one , I also ask people to understand how much pregnancy meant in one's life.",1651363225

My take is that oil will continue to be highly profitable(crush earnings) even if the crude price falls. It doesn’t need to be that high to have great margins. Above average dividends as well. Energy will continue to outperform the rest of the market imo. 

Pent up demand for summer travel is already showing very positive signs. It’s already incredibly hard to find hotels and flights if you haven’t already booked summer plans. 

I remember reading articles in mid 2021 about how more Americans than ever have large amounts of cash in savings due to all of that stimulus money. It’s weird how we don’t hear about that anymore. I think some spending will dip(activities that boomed when we were locked down like Netflix) but travel will be fine.

**R4 (120) — LB Brandon Smith, Penn State**  
**R6 (189) — Edge Amare Barno, Virginia**  
**R6 (199) — T Cade Mays, Tennessee**  
**R7 (242) — CB Kalon Barnes, Baylor**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Day 1:** The board couldn’t have fallen much better for Carolina, with all three of the top offensive tackle prospects still on the board. The Panthers opted for the top run-blocker in the class in Ekwonu. The N.C. State tackle earned PFF run-blocking grades above 85.0 in all three of his college seasons, with grades above 90.0 in each of the last two years. It’s worth noting that the Panthers didn’t trade back to add another pick or two, given that they aren’t on the clock again until the fourth round.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Day 2:** Corral wouldn’t have been a good pick in Round 1, but he provides value late on Day 2. Corral’s offense at Ole Miss made his projection to the NFL a little more difficult, as it was full of RPOs and simplistic reads. Despite the quarterback-friendly offense, Corral was consistently on time and delivered accurate throws while showing off an exceptional deep ball. Corral’s 2021 season took a nosedive midseason due to injury. His 91.1 PFF grade through Week 7 was the fourth-highest in the FBS, but that mark fell 20 grading points to 70.6 from Week 8 on.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Day 3:** Smith is an athletic project, but he’s a project well worth taking at this stage of the draft. The production profile isn’t overly impressive. Smith earned PFF grades below 60.0 in each of the last two years at Penn State. But the NFL is always going to look for 6-foot-4, 250-pound linebackers who test above the 90th percentile in the 40-yard dash, broad jump and short shuttle. Now, the Panthers just need to figure out how to use him.

"ClassicTrance","t5_2sf0p","My favorite BT production to start us off! A great choice for an opener. For the first transition into ""Amnesiac"", I can definitely understand your thought process when making it. The phrasing is good but I believe that if you started ""Amnesiac"" earlier, it would have helped carry the energy from ""Mercury &amp; Solace"" a lot better. The next couple of transitions are much better and they keep your mix flowing pretty well. Just like the first transition, I think if you started ""Where are you now"" much earlier, it would have helped keep some of the energy from ""I Don't Wanna Lose My Way"" much more effectively. Moving on, the transition into ""Godspeed"" is really well executed. From then on, it's quite an easy trip to the closing with ""Only One."" Overall, I think your set is great due to its tracklist. (Specially cuz I love ""Mercury &amp; Solace"" and ""Godspeed"") However, I think it could have been a lot better in terms of actual flow due to the reasons I mentioned. Great effort man!

"woodworking","t5_2qlqp","Hey and thanks - all just a hobby for me but happy to share the projector dets - it’s an Aikuri P09-II. Sold in lots of online places, aliexpress was the cheapest for me at 180us. 
Native 854x480 resolution - it’s bright enough to show a decent smaller image in a lit room and obviously no issues for a larger image in a darker room. Tiny little thing with its own rechargeable battery, wifi, Bluetooth, one hdmi in, sd card port and a decent os with a browser, media players, etc. really didn’t expect much for the money but very impressed.

&gt;After being recently discharged from military service and just drifting through life, Hanbin Ryu is suddenly transported to another world. However, his “guide line,” the system bestowed upon him to help with his survival and growth, was filled with errors, causing him to be stuck in the tutorial stage for over 20 years. When he is finally released from this personal hell, he finds everyone has turned against otherworlders like him. Just how will this low-level, super-tutorial newbie survive?

I respect your perspective. Now that you mention it, I suppose I can imagine Chinese nationalists, the 网红 crowd, talking about stuff like this. They don't control china though, the CCP does. And it's contrary to what I've read about what they think. Xi was in Moscow in *February* telling Putin their friendship had ""no limits"". Last month or two has shown it clearly does have limits, but considering the realpolitik and the relationship between China and the US, I can't really see it's in the CCP's interests to go on some conquest of Russia.

I guess the second part of it is that it doesn't matter what people in China think if there's just very little chance of Russia splintering on geographical bounds, besides, say, a few breakaway republics in the southwest. The map looks like it's drawn by someone who has never thought about the relevance of population and power centres in Russia and probably hasn't thought about Russian geography beyond a Risk map.",1651363228

"IsaacArthur","t5_3g7ux","But you don't get the information before you shoot, because FTL information still takes time to reach the target, and that information wasn't sent until AFTER the shot was fired.

Time 1: I fire the shot.Time 2: They receive the information that the shot was firedTime 3: They send the message backTime 4: I receive the message they sent

In all cases, from MY perspective, T1 &lt; T4.

The problem with relativity here is that from my perspective I also receive a message from them (T4) before they apparently send it (T3). Because the message travels faster than the light showing them sending it. So it looks like T4 &lt; T3. This is what is always given as the problem. And the reason it's a problem is because there aren't supposed to be any preferred reference frames under relativity. So there's no ""objective time"" only relative times, and everything is supposed to make sense in all relative time frames so receiving a message before it was apparently sent violates that.

Turning his ult into some damage reduction (kind of like old Maokai ult) and pumping more power into the rest of his kit as a tradeoff would be a much better direction for him imo. Fixing his insane mana issues would be a good start.

Sadly I worked in dollar tree when I was a teenager in 2015 and 2016. Had to be the worst experience I’ve had in my life.  I’m not even joking. I was overworked, with lines wrapping around the store out into the street. We were penalized for items that were incorrectly scanned and taken off the customers order, yet we had to scan super fast to keep the lines down so errors were inevitable. I worked in an improvised area so theft was a big issue and we were made to be security too . If someone is stealing water from dollar tree they obviously need it…..

A customer threw an item at me across the store because I wasn’t going fast enough but I was the only cashier. I never felt so humiliated and disrespected for $7.50/hr in my life. The store was packed and no one really came to my defense. I was just an 18 y/o girl assaulted by what appeared to be a middle aged man.

It stands for post SSRI sexual dysfunction. (Because it occurs after ppl quit meds) It's under-resourced so no hard number on how common it is or what the recovery path looks like. Some get full functioning back after quitting, some never improve even after decades. r/PSSD talks about this. 

Antidepressants can also cause protracted withdrawal. So if you chose to quit you can have nasty symptoms that last a very long time (like years). Including brain zaps, nausea, anxiety, and more. 

They can cause intense anger. I experienced that. I would go into a blinding rage breaking everything around me yelling at ppl and telling my friends to kill themselves at the drop of a hat.

Only service in elite combat units comes close.

You also have to be 100% certain about it as well because *any* shred of doubt will make doctors take it away from you. This often leads to people lying about how certain they are to doctors because if they told the truth they'd get denied, which is extremely counterproductive and entirely the fault of the system that demonizes trans care and expects zero uncertainty in our decisions. (I mean really, what decision *ever* did you have complete certainty in? Zero doubt whatsoever? It's such an unrealistic expectation to have.)

"tressless","t5_2shlm","I had shock loss throughout my whole hair. It just didn’t come back as full in my temples/middle front hairline. I was already planning on lowering my hairline prior to getting sick because I didn’t like the size of my forehead. So the transplant in the spots that needed it seemed more logical than just lowering the hairline. I’ve never liked the fact I was always needing to cover it up and wore a hat when it was windy. I know it wasn’t very bad. But it still affected my confidence. And with the new medication making my hair worse I wasn’t able to make any gains. Just stay stable with worse hair than before getting sick. I’m basically able to stay stable now. Bunch of meds attacking my hair and other meds keeping it. I knew If I didn’t do anything It would defiantly all be gone by now 

Ya a NW 1 isn’t bad at all. I really wouldn’t even consider that blading really. Or a bad hairline. I think it gives it a much better look than a perfect hairline. Even when I did my transplant I didn’t want something super fake like you see some guys get from Turkey. How old are you? You must be one of the lucky ones that’s able to keep a good head of hair. Why do you come to this subreddit? Is it something that you think about happening? Are you on any meds to keep your hair to help off set the thyroid medication? I’m on anti rejection meds. I’ve gone through a few different ones since some just destroyed my fucking hair so fast",1651363231

"beyondthebump","t5_2u06v","I had an emergency c-section back in February. I want a planned c-section for my next baby, with no interest in a VBAC. 

Heading into my delivery, my biggest fear was a c-section. I did not plan for one at ALL (mentally or physically). Because of that, I was devastated once they broke the news to me that I needed one (baby ended up stuck in my pelvis), and my recovery mentally was the hardest part. Felt like my body failed, and my delivery wasn’t at all what I imagined.

The first ~2 weeks were really difficult for me, again mostly because I did not do any preparation for the possibility of me ending up having a c-section. But after that, and once I got more comfortable moving around, it was fine. I fortunately didn’t experience much pain at all for recovery. I was almost fully mobile by week 3 or 4. I had no difficult ever lifting up my baby. The only time it sucked was wanting to but not being able to feed lying down in bed until about week 4 or 5, once the stitches were healed. 

I have no interest in a VBAC I guess because to me I now know fully what to expect for c-section recovery whereas a vaginal delivery would be yet again something new and scary for me. I’ve also had a handful of friends say a second (and planned) c-section is so much easier.

Pros and cons to both but i personally have not a lot of bad things to say about my c-section.",1651363231

"starcitizen","t5_2v94d","THing is, those games you mention are extremely basic, in the level of actual processing they do... they look good, but they're nowhere near the level of SC in terms of the amound of processing.

E.g. in SC even the ground you're walking on it being generated in real-time, as you walk... it's not a pre-processed map (because storing pre-processed data about entire planets would be too much even for modern drives... we're talking likely Terrabytes of data per planet).  Add on the fact that there is no 'skybox' - your machine is actually simulating / processing the entire star system, to calculate the light from the central Star, etc, and similar levels of crazy processing, and it should be apparent why SC performance doesn't match to the other games.

This is also why - to a point - I can't play most modern games for long... it's too easy to see where they've taken shortcuts / used 'industry standard' designs, compared to what SC does... and it's irritating.

Not saying that SC is perfect etc - far from it... but I do appreciated the effort their taking to try and find 'better' ways to do things, rather than just settling for 'industry standard' solutions (especially since many of those solutions were developed in the days of 1st and 2nd Gen consoles, or earlier... and continuing to use them now is just laziness).",1651363232

"SPACs","t5_2ohexx","I make my money on investigating fud 

I have been able to time when fud is comming ir going many times by talking with other traders and sorting threw stuff 

It can be a very powerful ally if u can predict when it will happen or when it will leave 

In no way am I trying to spread fud more seeing if any is comming 

I have found that there is bread crumbs leading up to a event 

So let's take leafly 

Let's say that no one exercises there fpa rights 

And all those holders held which I believe many have due to no large filings 

So if all of them hold thst is a massive show of strength for leafly and if it leads into a good earnings I could see 14 dollars 

Now if they plan to exercise that a different story 

So why have I been questioning price activity 

Well there is 1.4 million shares short all under water 
With such disssmal volume u think someone would slap it down. Unless most those shares were above nav that were shorted and the founder hedged there bet. Let's say the 1.4 million shorts in the first fpa basically want out. Well mcmj/lfly already resold there shares in effect .... they take back the 1.4 million and close there short ... and prolly profited on it 
What if no one is going to cash in there fpa 
Well they turn off the algo and it falls and they buy back there short 

What dates am I looking to see if any of this is right prolly 4 trading days after may 5th so we will say earnings date. If I don't see a large return of shorts and the price is still elevated then we can assume fpa's didn't return shares most likely and the price is just natural related to no shorts available 

Now here is the bull side 
If nothing is returned before earnings and price continues to rise, and as u mentioned s1 is delayed. This thing could go nuclear. As it looks like everyone is happy in there positions. Also little relief will be given to shorts when the s1 is filed because there is no pipe .

Again I am certainly not trying to spread any fud as it's more of a wait and see game..I.. mostly trying to see how long we wait and what we are looking for.",1651363233

She blamed it on me for not “sticking with it” … pretty sure I might have been 8-10 years old when that happened.  So I had no middle school or high school education.  I did graduate from college though (yay me).

A couple of years ago I asked why she didn’t put me back into normal school.  She said “I always liked the idea of homeschooling you”.  That was it.  It was that simple for her.

"vagabond","t5_2rogv","Well, when I was backpacking overseas, I found like minded travelers to hang and travel with at, in the following order:

1.  Hostels
2.  Train stations
3.  Bus stations

But in The U.S., hostels are overpriced and rather yuppyish, Amtrak is pretty much the only passenger train service and often costs more than flying, and most intercity bus stations are way too sketchy for me.  

The OP asked for places similar to ""Slab City"", and I'm personally not aware of anything like that in Germany.  Slab City is somewhat unique here in the U.S., in the desert, considered ""deserted territory."" 

it's possible to survive there, a number of people do, but it's not easy.  There's no utility services, no potable water, no actual services of any kind, including police, fire or rescue. In the middle of the desert, so your ability to grow any kind of food is both challenging and limited.  Anarchy reigns, so can be dangerous.  Very dangerous. 

Cool place to visit though, as long as you don't get on the wrong side of anyone who lives there. 

Not aware of anyplace similar in Germany, but Atlas Obscura lists places that are unique, odd, weird, etc.  So it's about as close as I could get to what it seemed the OP was looking for.",1651363234

I've been a Superintendent for two year and I've done a year in my own school in a special centre. All done before I had my CID.

If I had to go back I wouldn't do the special centre. Its typically less hours, less pay and ultimately the work was more tedious.

Oddly the full Superintendent position was better because it was busier. You've a lot more to do, it's all very doable, but it's not as mind numbingly boring. And ultimately the pay is better.

The reserves are usually called on because people tend to drop off. And also, from my experience, being on the reserve panel one year tends to put you closer to the top of the list the next year.

Because Abraham Lincoln did not have the power to unilaterally ban slavery everywhere in the country, hence the 13th Amendment. He justified the Emancipation Proclamation by claiming that he was seizing ""war contraband.""

"HighStrangeness","t5_2qvz6","A few years back at our family cabin. I think 2015? It was probably around 2 am and I was laying in bed reading a book when I hear a coyote out in the neighboring field start screaming. Like blood curling screams. I jump up and ran outside, standing on the front deck. Listening I can tell this coyote is fighting for his life and is giving as good as he's getting in the fight, but I'm not hearing the other creature make a sound.

For whatever reason I was compelled to check it out. I can't stress enough how painfully driven I was. There was one little snag - my husband forgot to pack my boots and all I had were a cheap pair if flip flops. I ran inside and tried to play Goldie Locks with everyone's shoes but none if them fit well enough for me wear. I ran outside and tried so hard to walk through the woods to our property line where the field is, but it was just too dark and uneven for me to make it in the shoes I had.

So I ran back to the porch and just had to listen. I was pacing back and forth and fretting because I felt I HAD to be there but I couldn't and it was awful. I was so consumed with the feeling of having to be there. 

And then the coyote let out one last cry and went silent. And at that moment I was hit with a wall of sound. Dogs all over were barking and howling suddenly, frogs, crickets, the whole sounds of the woods were back. I didn't even noticed but the entire time the coyote was screaming, that was the only noise there was.

And that's when I heard foot steps. They were very clearly on our property and were from something bipedal. I squinted where they were coming from and by now were close enough to the cabin (and it's many porch lights) I should have been able to see what it was but I saw nothing. They kept coming closer and at that moment I ran inside, locked the door, and woke my husband up. He hadn't heard a thing.

Eta - please forgive any weird typos, I tried my best to edit the ones I found but my phone's keyboard was acting wonky. I  also have other stories about that cabin but that was definitely the scariest.",1651363235

Yağmurlu bir havada yürüyerek herhangibir sahiline gidersen ne kadar kötü koktuğunu fark edebilirsin ya da neredeyse her yağmurda kemeraltını su bastığını fark edebilirsin. Biraz bakarsan tunç soyerin ne kadar saçma sapan işlere ne kadar paralar döktüğünü görebilirsin. Şehrin içinde biraz araba sürersen ya da araba süren birisiyle biraz muhabbet edersen yolların ne kadar bozuk olduğunu fark edebilirsin. Depremin üzerinden 1.5 yıl geçmesine rağmen hâlâ yıkılmayı bekleyen binalar olduğunu görebilirsin. Sahile inersen insanların etrafı ne kadar kirlettiğini görebilirsin ve aynı şekilde vapur iskelelerinden birinin yanına gidip, denize bakarsan ne kadar çöp dolu olduğunu görebilirsin. Saat kulesi çevresinde yanında herhangi bir kız varken gezersen, saat kulesi çevresindeki kadınların sana zorla gül satmaya çalıştığını ya da zorla fal bakmaya çalıştığını görebilirsin. Tepeciğe hastaneye gidersen romanların senden nasıl zorla park parası aldığını, eğer park parası vermezsen arabana zarar verdiklerine şahit olabilirsin. Ilıca tanay tabiat parkına gidersen insanların ne kadar bilinçsiz bir şekilde parkı kirlettiklerini görebilirsin. Belli saatlerde çevre yoluna çıkarsan ne kadar trafik olduğunu görebilirsin ki sanırım senin kent merkezlerin çevre yollarını kapsamıyor. Seçim dönemlerinde ya da özel etkinliklerde kordona gidersen, ortalığın ne kadar pkklı terörist kaynadığını görebilirsin ki bu teröristler 3-5 kişi falan da değil haberin olsun belki yüzlerce belki binlerce kişi ve Atatürkü bu kadar seviyoruz diye gezen bi şehir için bırak binlerce, yüzlerce kişiyi 3-5 tane bile terörist barındırması absürt kaçar. Mavişehire yolun düşerse yan yana yapılmış 3 tane avm görebilirsin. İnciraltı kent ormanına yolun düşerse insanların güzelim ormanı ne kadar berbat ettiklerini görebilirsin. Konak tünelini geçip konağın arka taraflarına bakarsan her tarafa gece kondu dikilip nasıl mahvedildiğine bakabilirsin. Saat kulesinin eski fotoğraflarına bakarsan denizi doldurup üstüne yol yapıldığını görebilirsin ki bununla alakalı hicbir şikayetim yok ama bunu yapan insan sokakları da biraz geniş yapabilir değil mi? Bayraklının tepelerine çıkmaya çalışırsan ne kadar dik yokuşları olduğunu görebilirsin. Karşıyakanın 60'lar ve 70'lerdeki fotoğraflarını dikkatle incelersen deniz kenarındaki 1-2 katlı mükemmel mimarisi olan köşkleri 10 yıl içinde yıkıp, yerlerine nasıl 5-6 katlı apartmanlar diktiklerini görebilirsin.",1651363236

We've found this is a better way of people getting answers from knowledgeable users rather than 300-500 standalone posts per day. These threads often either didn't receive any answers or received a deluge of answers, many of which were of poor quality or flat-out wrong.

"bostonceltics","t5_2qmkf","100% onboard with what u/CelticsJ is saying about Smart. He has been ascending since last year's playoffs. He is becoming a late blooming offensive weapon to go along with his DPOY level defense. Now, he's not on Jrue's level or prime Kyle Lowry's level offensively, but take a quick look at his numbers the past 2 post-seasons. Add that to what we all know he did this year when he was finally given the reigns as the primary PG. He's blooming as an offensive player.

100% agree with u/Wayne_Spooney when it comes to PP. He is going to be vital. Like Spooney said, he'll get the open looks this series. He also won't be in actions where he has to guard Kyrie or KD. Jrue and the 3pt shooters for the Bucks are a much better defensive match-up for him. As long as PP can be a net neutral defensively, he's going to be important.

100% agree with Real_BSmooth. Giannis is the best player in this series and the Bucks have put a team around him that fit him perfectly. The fit for this team is 10000% better than the fit for the Nets team we just played. The pieces Giannis has are perfect for him, even without Middleton.

I did want to add a couple of things to the conversation:

1. Other than closing time, the other issue with Middleton is actually an issue with Giannis and Jrue. To start, Giannis doesn't play 40+ minutes per game like KD and Kyrie. It's very rare for Giannis to get that kind of minutes, even in competitive series. So the problem is offensive production when he sits down. Yes, this team has shooters, but who is left to get them open when Giannis sits? Which brings me to the issue of Jrue. Jrue CAN be that guy, but can he be with Smart guarding him? We just saw Smart shut down a much much better offensive player in Kyrie for 3 straight games and Kyrie doesn't have the hardest defensive assignment on the other end to worry about. Without Middleton, it becomes increasingly difficult to get any offense when Giannis sits.

2. Offensive fouls. Smart, White, and Grant Williams are among the best in the league at drawing charges. This is Giannis's biggest weakness. He gets called for a lot of charges because his style of play is to barrel through guys. We have a handful of players who can and will step in front of the freight train that is Giannis. If he gets into any sort of foul trouble, then I point you back to point #1.",1651363240

&gt; The family of Paul Rusesabagina, the subject of Oscar-nominated film Hotel Rwanda, have filed a $400m lawsuit in the United States over his alleged abduction and torture.

&gt; In a statement, Rusesabagina&amp;#039;s family accused the Rwandan government and high-ranking officials of conspiring to &amp;quot;Facilitate and execute an elaborate plot to lure&amp;quot; Rusesabagina from his home in San Antonio to Rwanda &amp;quot;Where he would be tortured and illegally detained for the remainder of his life&amp;quot;.

&gt; The Hollywood film, Hotel Rwanda, was made in 2004, and featured Don Cheadle as Rusesabagina.

"cobrakai","t5_3ncyn","I'm not sure I agree. Not that it's their fault, but Johnny's relationship with Miguel and with Carmen has made him a much worse father to Robby than he ever was before. Compare season 1, when he writes Robby a letter reaching out to him, wants to ask him to move in, and races over to him when he gets injured in the AVT, to season 4, when he leaves him with Kreese and doesn't look back, and slams the door in his face the one time Robby comes to him. Again, this is on Johnny, but having Miguel and Carmen in his life makes him care less about Robby and about fixing things with him. Johnny's attitude seems to be that having Robby in his life would be a good bonus, but it doesn't seem like he truly cares if he and Robby ever fix things, because he already has everything he needs from Miguel and Carmen. This may not be the show's intention, but this is how it comes across to me.",1651363241

Did WW2 end when we ""wiped every German soldier off the planet""? No, because we still understood that for all their faults they were human beings, not mindless monsters.

What I'm questioning is your statement of ""guillotine for all these scum suckers"". You've decided that every single Russian soldier is inherently evil and just waiting for a chance to commit atrocities. This is exactly the consequence of dehumanizing people I was talking about. If all Russians are evil monsters, then there can be no peace until every single one has been killed. How does that help the Ukrainian people?

At the end of the day, do you want peace in Ukraine, or do you want to continue enjoying videos of Russian soldiers dying and then getting mad when Ukrainians die?",1651363241
"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","&gt; If you read what I said, you would realize that's not it.

It literally is. A bunch of people with more money for mortgages would increase the price/availability of housing. The logical conclusion of your argument is that people cannot get money for mortgages in order to preserve the housing market.

Do you think that is an attractive argument to make?

&gt;You said people not having debt would benefit OP economically as well.

Yes, that's how our economical system works. You get money spenders into an area, that area prospers. As for OP specifically, I don't know. You argued that OP wouldn't benefit because they might want to purchase a house. I can just as well argue that they would benefit because they want to sell a house.

On average, YOU benefit if other people around you have more money.",1651363241

Once they get rolling tho, they are super fun to play.

I recently finished a game as the Raj in Rahen with Vanrahar, the Harimari formable that's almost Prussian levels of military bonuses.

Early on it was suuuuuuper annoying to beat them, but once I got a few of my idea sets down, I could steamroll the Command.

And tho I wouldn't call them challenging, I did supremely enjoy my Corvuria campaign; slowly (and not-so-slowly) taking over all of Cannor with my immortal vampire king who was also a powerful mage with legendary abilities in I think 4 or 5 schools of magic by the end. Good fun!",1651363242

At 7-8, LB mass cannot escape the archer mass anymore and their best bet is to die fighting to take out as many resources as they can unless the map is Altai or something equally short.

3) Knights aren't archer counters. Get horsemen if you want to spend your food on something and mass them properly. Bait spearmen out of formation so you can shift-que your archers to take them out. Use knights to harass eco during fights, before fights, after fights, or to pick up reinforcements.

* Vote to allow Reddit Admin to host an r/anime Reddit Talk. ***[Vote Failed]***

* Votes to codify our handling of Opening/Ending (OP/ED) sequence posts:
 * Vote to allow OP/EDs to be posted as [Official Media] when they meet the criteria for the flair. ***[Vote Passed]***
 * Vote to allow OP/EDs to be posted as [Clips] when they do not meet the criteria for Official Media. ***[Vote Passed]***
 * Vote to waive the 1-week delay when posting a new OP/ED as a Clip. ***[Vote Passed]***

  Note: The above votes did not fundamentally change how we currently handle OP/ED sequences, and all other Official Media, Clip, and repost rules still apply. We debated internally whether we wanted to only allow OP/ED sequences when they satisfy Official Media rules, or to potentially categorize all OP/ED sequences as Clips even if they fit the Official Media format. We ultimately voted to continue allowing them under either flair depending on the manner in which they are posted.

* Vote to change the wording on our Clip Rules to state that dialogue subtitles are required, but music lyric subtitles are not. ***[Vote Passed]***

* Proposal for a daily discussion thread to potentially replace some of our existing weekly threads.

* Began internal discussion about flair usage and expected content types such as text, video, image, etc.

* u/Supremegypsy has rejoined the mod team.  
[](#absolutely)

* u/Bainos has stepped down from the mod team.

i glare at everyone and i don't even drink anymore hahaha.  i'm just not a fan of the human race.  my first husband was one of those disgusting scotch sweaters.  seriously, he fucking reeked and there were times i told him to go sleep somewhere else or i would.  but he was also an attorney for the public defender and i think most of his clients were fully aware but just glad to have representation, period, and probably most of the people he worked with were drunk all the time too because it's a shitty job.

i almost always get eating disorder but they don't pick the right one lol.  it's also not intrusive anymore.  i'm thin and i won't eat in front of people and i've gone through the, ""i can't eat that because i'm a vegan,"" excuse.   i've been a vegetarian for over 40 years, and actually tried vegan for awhile but it's awful and restrictive.

i was genuinely sick one time and had to call EMTs and when one woman was strapping me in, she said, ""have you been drinking listerine?"" HAHA i said, ""no.  i just brushed my teeth as a favor to people who are going to be really close to me.""",1651363245

I seen shadow warriors at my LGS and a start collecting Greywater Fastness box set that is all oldhammer dwarves. The only old models you def won’t see in AoS are unique named heroes like Tyrion or Grimgor. Some oldhammer heroes got a makeover like Morathi and Teclis but they have all new unique models. Some oldhammer armies got warscrolls without being lumped into Cities of Sigmar like Bretonnia and Tomb Kings, but they never got their own tomes. Idk if you can still find those warscrolls tho.

"AskProfessors","t5_2tvlb","None of the schools I’ve looked at require securing a supervisor before applying. However, some schools encourage on their admissions page that you reach out to potential supervisors in advance.

Idk how to say this without sounding like an ass, but affordability isn’t really an issue. I was more so wondering how many schools I should apply to considering the number of LORs/forms my professors would have to fill out for each school.

I have one school in mind that I’d for sure accept if I got in because I have a supervisor who I know I work well with and has agreed to supervise me, and supervisory fit is important to me.

I got upbraided on another one of my accounts for admitting that I stopped masking at work only because I cannot deal with the constant judgement of my coworkers anymore. It's emotionally exhausting.

If you're only interested in formula 1 it may be a bit of a grind  to get the required license class, but if you're interested in open wheel there are good options to try as you go up in the license classes.  I think that the formula 1 car is in a class or b class so you need to progress from rookies, d, c, b and then potentially a.

Getting to a class is easy, but it takes time.  I've reached a class but most of my racing is in either c or d class series.  If you're only interested in the higher series, it may not be enjoyable to you too grind that out.  I really enjoy the mx5 and radical so that was never really a problem, I got to the higher classes just by having fun in the cars I enjoyed.

The race sim studio mods for assetto cords are very good and I just finished a season of them in assetto Corsa.  Might be worth checking them out and joining a league.

There are also f1 cars in ams2, I have it a try and really enjoyed it.  Very different than the formula 1 cars in assetto, there are things I like I'm both but both are fun for me.

I've yet to try the formula 1 car in iracing because I've got my fix in other games and it's a car you need to buy.  So I don't know how it is to drive or what the participation rates are like.

For me, I've still got an active sub but since joining a league, I've not been in iracing to much as most of my sim time is in the league racing now.",1651363246

Obviously the best thing is to park your car in a garage, but that's not an option for most people.

I was thinking how about a motion sensor that triggers a loud alarm, places under the car after you park for the night?

What's known in the anime so far 
1. She was booted from Itsuki's party and claims to have been falsely accursed [verified by Melty who probably got information from a shadow], which caused her to attempt suicide via drowning
2. The current hengen muso master says she'll be the next master
3. She wears a penguin and later a full costume as a stat booster and she can hide when she upset 
4 she in love with the bow hero who apparently saved her from becoming a illegal slave (most likely a sex slave)
5. She likes books
6. She has a self confidence issue

In Manga and light novel we know much more
&gt;!she physically weak with terrible stats (staying stats were ok but they never really increased with level (meaning at level 68 a level 10 Raphtalia had better stats and that was before Naofumi got a slave boost). She smart she was going to a school in Faubrey until her parents rand out of money the only subject she failed in whas physical Ed. Her family are minor nobles in charch of a small village but where poor so loved in a farm house. Financial is trouble started when a rival noble from the next town over started sending goons and offered guards to protect them at high cost and loans (this is what caused her to drop out of school) then they kidnapped her as payment for said loans. [Itsuki step in here and rescued her one of the good things he actually done] she fell in love with Itsuki as he her hero when she needed one] she joined his party to be with him and just accepted the piss poor treatment from the other party members for over a month she was hazed made to have the smallest meals carry all the gear, last one on the totem pole and with her low stats she never had a chance to prove herself and get out of that position, even at her class up she was highly encourage to be a front liner (trying to increase her stats) when she has more talent in magic. After making a suggestion about using the ruckor fruit bombs against Glass and the Cal Mira wave she was praised by the Queen this set off Itsuki's party members who them broke one of Itsuki's accessories and pin the blame on her in order to kick her out (Itsuki was informed of this plot by a shadow but still kick her out) when confronted by Naofumi about that he change his tune saying it was for her benefit as she has no place with him, this rejects cause her to run off (light novel Itsuki actually shots Naofumi who tanks his shots with out even using the shield and catches a defense ignoring attack with his hand proving Itsuki can't harm him, he them chases after Rishia where Filo saved her from her suicide by drowning.  During training we find out that she good at magic (not great) and she a rare person who has every magic affinity I stead of the usual 2 that most people have. When the hengen muso master sees her she instantly knows that he has a once in a hundred years talent for ki that her martials arts used and makes Rishia get successor. Overall she has a self confidence problem due to low stats and being picked on for awhile so her actions are much more believable. Later we find out she also a late boomer build and will see major stat increase once she breaks though level 70 by late 70's she passing Raphtalia stats. !&lt;

This was John Moneys original theory, which his experiment debunked. The ""sister"" never accepted his female upbringing despite never knowing he was actually male until it was admitted to him after the experiment; refuting the idea that gender is non-biological in nature. Yet we still have a huge movement today claiming this same false belief, in an attempt to validate a tiny percentage of the population's mental illness (gender dysphoria, aka transgender). According to a recent census, trans people make up 0.25% of the population, yet we have removed biology based sex ed from schools in favour of teaching that gender is in your head and not attached to your sex. We then see an up tick in kids identifying as trans, and the government sees it as affirmative action, not that they are indoctrinating impressionable minds.",1651363247

Is it in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that.

As someone who is a scientist who studies crows, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one calls jackdaws crows. If you want to be ""specific"" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.

If you're saying ""crow family"" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Corvidae, which includes things from nutcrackers to blue jays to ravens.

So your reasoning for calling a jackdaw a crow is because random people ""call the black ones crows?"" Let's get grackles and blackbirds in there, then, too.

Also, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A jackdaw is a jackdaw and a member of the crow family. But that's not what you said. You said a jackdaw is a crow, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the crow family crows, which means you'd call blue jays, ravens, and other birds crows, too. Which you said you don't.

I've called it pointless because meeting antediluvians is an obvious plot device for godlike NPCs for whom common sense and regular rules do not apply. It's pointless because the only thing deciding whether an antediluvian can actually be successfully diablerized is an history-changing moment that the ST decides to place there.

Lastly, I've called it pointless because even the idea itself sounds bad to play, like a power fantasy story from a combat manga like Bleach; and doesn't seem to be much of a point to play Vampire for this story, god-killing is more for Exalted.

"GunAccessoriesForSale","t5_h4uwp","Paypal offers two different services.  Paypal Friends and Family (F&amp;F) has zero fees, but offer no protections and makes the buyer vulnerable to scammers.  Paypal Goods and Services (G&amp;S) charges an additional ~3% of the item price (actually 3.49% and $0.49 as of 2021), but provides the buyer insurance in case the seller dissapears without providing the item.  Paypal does prohibit [some specific items](https://web.archive.org/web/20180409201310/https://www.paypal.com/us/selfhelp/article/what-is-paypal%E2%80%99s-policy-on-transactions-that-involve-firearms-faq585) but has a ""catch all comment"" that may apply to others, so NO NOTES IN PAYPAL. As a general guideline, if a buyer wants to use Paypal G&amp;S rather than F&amp;F with an **established GAFS member**, it is expected that they will absorb the +3% fee for the increased protections that it provides them. [Here is a easy fee calculator](https://thefeecalculator.com/). If a seller specifies a F&amp;F price, assume that is his ""to his pocket"" cost. However these terms are up for negotiation between the buyer and seller. It is recommended to pay via G&amp;S and absorb the fee. If the seller mandates F&amp;F, be wary of a scam and use a [Scam prevention method](https://www.reddit.com/r/GunAccessoriesForSale/wiki/proxy).  Additionally, Paypal has deleted the account of several members due to using F&amp;F for purchases.  Paypal considers this theft from them (you're stealing their fees), and a violation of their [ToS](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/useragreement-full). DO NOT put notes in F&amp;F payments as it is evidence you may be violating PP ToS.

It's probably not the answer you want to hear but if you're jacking the car up often it's totally worth the hundredish bucks. 

Otherwise, I guess lift from the rear jack point until you can put a stand under the front point on both sides. Then lift from the rear diff for the rear points.

And where you are isn't bad. It's wishing you were starting somewhere else that's the painful thing.

Also even if you feel you're back to square 1, you're really not. You're starting with a lot more knowledge and experience and perspective, and that make for a big head start.

So please be good to yourself. Do what you *can* do, even if it's just a walk around the block, and be at the ready to do more as your body is able. It might feel like a big deal now, but in a few months it will be like nothing, and in a few years you won't even remember it.",1651363249

As suggested by others, your best bet if you want to know exactly what is going on it terms of orbital interactions and what your homo and lumo look like would be to do a quick dft calculation.

&gt; A military general and 10 others acknowledged this week that they had committed war crimes and crimes against humanity, testifying at an emotional two-day hearing that was the first of its kind in a special court set up to confront the legacy of Colombia&amp;#039;s crushing civil war.

&gt; The hearing, according to Colombian court officials, represents the first time that perpetrators have admitted to committing war crimes and crimes against humanity as a result of a court created by a peace accord.

&gt; In all, the court said in a recent investigative report that the military is responsible for killing 6,402 civilians and claiming they were rebels.

"medicalschool","t5_2re2p","I do admissions for medical school, not residency but I'm gonna throw my 2 cents in anyway. Most personal statements won't change things drastically in either direction. Things to absolutely please avoid are:

1. poorly edited personal statements: seriously, have a few people look it over. make sure there's no major grammatical errors, confusing phrasing, or misspelled words.

2. telling a story about you being unethical or a story where you are bashing another specialty/profession: sounds obvious but make sure you get other people's opinions on the story you are telling. You might think it shows how you are hard-working or smart but others might read it as you being shitty to work with if it focuses on you getting ahead at the expense of someone else. Don't talk about lying to get more surgery time or pulling crazy hours that may have made you unsafe as a provider.

3. focusing on the wrong thing: don't talk about attending lifestyle/pay as reason you're choosing the specialty. Yeah, we should all be taking into account how the specialty we choose will ultimately play into our work-life balance but admissions is still the time when we all gotta at least act like this is purely a calling and financial/status gains are not part of our calculations. You still gotta feed the egos of the people who read your app and they generally want to be reminded that they took this path for purely high-minded reasons and not so they could afford a vacation home and to get their kid a pony or whatever.

&amp;#x200B;

Other than those things, don't worry about being original or legitmately standing out. Try to write something that shows why you are a good fit for what you want and why you will be a good resident and get along with people or meaningfully contribute to your cohort. If your dying to go to a particular program consider personalizing to show why you'd be a great fit for that program specifically. If something is a legitimately important part of your life or your why, use it, but don't try to create a trauma story where there isn't one. And lastly, if you bring something up in your statement, be prepared to speak on it in an interview.",1651363251

Afterwards he’ll wrap me up in those beautiful, gentle arms and softly tell me how I belong to him, and I will always be safe with him, even if there’s pain. He tells me how happy he is with me, and thanks me for putting my complete trust in him. Sometimes I have a little cry because it’s so much!

See, the problem is that this statement is built on an assumption.

The only time it *should be* that the nanny isn't with him, is when the ex is with him. That's a fair assumption insofar as giving your families confidence that he's being watched and care for, but it doesn't mean its entirely true all the time. Its his own house - its entirely possible for him to get out of sight and into mischief for a few minutes, and that is all it would take.

Your son could have easily run off out of sight long enough to argue with the housekeeper, with the nanny either being careless/negligent (in which case, she'd lie to save her own skin), or just distracted/trailing just far enough behind to have not seen or heard what happened.

Ambient noise wasn't affecting the measurements much at all. There wasn't a single measurement that was rejected. The end correction graphs showed far more accuracy and consistency. 

The last time I measured this, the bass sounds were often way too loud and certain sounds would just suddenly get way too loud which caused me to move the volume up and down quite a bit throughout the movie. But now it seems perfect",1651363253

Many women still sacrifice their own career in order to support their partner and every woman makes a huge sacrifice in her career in order to have children, so that question made no sense at all.  You are arguing this as if this situation is personal and you have a personal experience where you lost everything or would lose everything if you were to divorce, you specifically brought up losing half of your business and said that the wife put nothing into your business but got half and that's just not the way divorce works. So now you are attacking the idea that any woman ever makes sacrifices for the good of their marriage.  You don't have any answers just more hatred for women.",1651363254

The gases in my stomach where so bad that I could actually feel myself stretching from the pressure. The doctor came in and did the usual hey, why you here? I told him and he put his stethoscope to my stomach and said 

""It sounds like machine guns going off in an 80's war movie!"" *insert machine gun impersonation here* With his arms and everything.

Now usually, I would've laughed. But I was in a lot of pain and now that I had been there for awhile, I was reaching my limit. My face, I'm sure was the polar opposite of amused. I forced a small smile and said ""Like Rambo?""

"Healthygamergg","t5_26y265","Hi! Thanks for the reply! I don’t know if I have been through specific moments where I've felt like opening up was painful, but I think it might come from a few different things.

I think as a child I tried super hard to never give my parents any reason to be upset and I did generally well at that, but I’m the older sister and I think my parents, if there was ever anything like an argument or something going on between me and my brother, they would always say stuff like “You're the oldest and you're a girl, you should be more mature” even when I was very young. I feel like they acted like it wasn’t okay for me to get mad or upset at things idk, I know they’ve always meant well but I don’t know if they were very good at validating how I felt, for some reason it sticks out to me my mom once saying I was being stupid for getting upset and crying in an argument. 

I've also always been very shy and felt reluctant sharing things with others (I literally didn’t even want to tell people what music or movies I liked cause it felt too personal) but I do think I was kinda let down by some of my close friends as a child. I generally had a hard time making friends and at about 5 to like 10yo only had one friend and I think we had a pretty toxic friendship, she was super jealous of me having any other friendships (which I didn’t lol) but sometimes she would just leave me randomly for other people when I had no one else besides her. She also started stealing from me and I realised she was doing it and eventually told her and she was like “Im such an awful friend, we can’t be friends anymore because of how awful I am” and stopped talking to me for a few days. She was my only friend and I felt so frustrated cause she was clearly in the wrong here but I was still the one running after her saying I didn’t mind and that I wasn’t mad and begging her to be my friend cause I had no one else. It was like I couldn’t even forgive her on my own terms. 

I eventually at like 12, made another close friend and we were super close for more than a year but we started hanging out with people who liked her but didn’t like me. I kept hanging out with them for around a year more and they were very obvious about not liking me and keeping me out of things and putting me down but I guess at the time I thought that was the price to pay for maintaining my one friendship. Eventually my friend ditched me basically saying they were tired of always having me around and that they just didn’t want me there so yeah.

I don’t think im the same person now I was then, I feel like it was all pretty stupid, I was clinging so much to certain people that I would let anyone walk all over me just to not be alone. I think after that I was like okayyyy never again and did a complete 180 and now at the smallest sign of being unwelcomed or unwanted Im out of there. I think Im just naturally a very reserved person but the way things played out didn’t help either.  
I generally feel uncomfortable and on edge around other people, I dont really feel like I know myself or how I'm perceived but I think that its something I can ignore if I'm alone but when engaging with others I get anxious about. I think part of me is afraid that when engaging with other people, they will confirm my suspicions or what I feel like I already know and don’t like about myself or feel ashamed about.

Sorry for the rant and for this being super long and maybe unrelated and sorry for any mistakes, english isnt my first language. But yeahh thanks again",1651363256

"ExNoContact","t5_319jr","I think that is just a part of the healing process, I am currently going through this. That emptiness you feel when you see something or you're put into a familiar space, it's probably dissociation. Some days it's stronger than others, but on the days where the emptiness hurts less, it's a win. It's not going to completely go away, but the fact that you are going through something like this means you are healing and that your feelings are slowly sorting itself out! Think back to days/weeks/months/years ago, where you were then compared to where you are now. I'm not going to sit here and lie and say that this feeling doesn't suck or that it's a great feeling, but time does heal: just keep doing what you're doing to better your life and distract from the pain, you're doing the absolute best you can!

I don't know exactly what your circumstance is, but maybe a part of you seeing these things or being in that familiar space and feeling empty is you detaching. I feel like the more exposure you get by yourself with these things or places, the more you'll detach or disassociate these places/things with a certain person.

The Marble Room is an upscale restaurant, ranked highly by tripadvisor and yelp reviewers, and located in a massive, repurposed bank lobby.

The Blue Point Grille is in the Warehouse District and is a personal favorite.  Its ambience reminds me of a New Orleans mainstay, such as Antoine's.  It, as do many downtown restaurants, has a great happy hour.  Also, highly ranked by reviewers.

Most of these restaurants are downtown, but not all of them:

[https://www.opentable.com/features/best-happy-hour-restaurants-downtown-cleveland-oh](https://www.opentable.com/features/best-happy-hour-restaurants-downtown-cleveland-oh)

Taza downtown is part of a Cleveland-based chain featuring Lebanese food.

Barrio downtown on Prospect is part of a Cleveland chain, but very popular.  Check out the East 5th Arcades while there, perhaps buying dessert at Colossal Cupcake.

[https://www.5thstreetarcades.com/about-us/](https://www.5thstreetarcades.com/about-us/)

Food guru Michael Symon, a Cleveland native, features Cleveland BBQ at his very popular East 4th St. Mabel's BBQ.  You likely still have to ask for traditional BBQ sauce.

[https://www.mabelsbbq.com/](https://www.mabelsbbq.com/)

[http://www.michaelsymon.com/television](http://www.michaelsymon.com/television)

East 4th St. is the heart of downtown's Gateway entertainment and dining district, which features Progressive Field and Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse.

[https://www.east4thstreet.com/shop-dine-experience](https://www.east4thstreet.com/shop-dine-experience)

You could take the Red Line rail rapid from the downtown RTA rail transit center to Little Italy and dine at Mia Bella or one of the other very good Italian restaurants located there.  Be certain to visit Presti's for dessert (grab a number when you first arrive).

[https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurants-g50207-zfn21228991-Cleveland\_Ohio.html](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurants-g50207-zfn21228991-Cleveland_Ohio.html)

You also could take the Blue or Green Line from the transit center to Shaker Square and dine at the unique EDWINS, highly regarded for its cuisine as well as its social purpose.

[https://edwinsrestaurant.org/about-us/](https://edwinsrestaurant.org/about-us/)

You could head west on the Red Line from downtown to the West 25th St. station and visit the famed West Side Market, and dine afterwards at the Great Lakes Brewpub, Townhall or other highly rated restaurant there, then visit Mitchell's afterwards for ice cream (go to the second floor parlor to see the ice cream factory located there).

Use the ""Plan a trip"" function at RTA web pages to check out mass transit options for any dining destination.

Not all of these restaurants are downtown.

"cordcutters","t5_2sa6y","Unfortunately when people shop for an Internet service, there is a misunderstanding on how their subscribed bandwidth speed translates into actual internal home Wireless signal coverage.

It doesn't translate.

If you have weak coverage in back rooms at 100Mb, then you will have weak coverage in those rooms at 300Mb or 1,000Mb.
 
But to answer your question, the 300Mb service should be more than enough bandwidth.

Your actual concern is how to deal with any locations with weak Wifi signal, because it sounds like all of your devices will be Wifi users and no directly ethernet wired.

You can first try to place your Wifi Router in a different location so that it can reach your whole home with better signal, which might require moving the device to a more centralized location and at least 4-5 ft off of the floor.

If you then still have weak areas, then you will have to look into ways to get those locations a stronger signal.

The best way is to use some sort of hardwired Wifi Access Point, either by having Ethernet cables installed or if you have pre-existing Cable TV Coax cables, then you can look into using MoCa adapters.

Otherwise your next best option is to use a Wifi Mesh system, like an Eero or a Deco or a ZenWifi or an Orbi.",1651363258

"BreakUps","t5_2ra79","Breaking up with you via text, without giving you a reason or a chance to respond is an absolutely vile thing to do.

I want to say something that is probably going to sound unkind, but I honestly do not mean it that way at all: 

If you don’t know how to live your life without someone, then you aren’t ready to live it with anyone.

I’ve only recently (at the age of 35) come to realise how true this is. If you read some of the stories on this subreddit, you’ll notice that many, many people admit to being anxious, depressed, or unhappy prior to their relationship. I don’t think this is a coincidence. If the foundation for the relationship (i.e. you) isn’t structurally sound, the relationship that stands upon it will inevitably crumble, if not sooner, then later.

The best thing that you, or I, or anyone going through this situation can do is to learn how to be happy without a relationship. At that point, a relationship ADDS to your happiness, rather than being the reason for it. We should never let our own happiness depend entirely upon the whims of another person.",1651363259

&gt; Yacht sales, new builds and yacht charters are all at record highs and further growth is projected into 2022, aided in part by the pandemic, he said.

It should go without saying that companies take maximum advantage of that little loophole they've arranged for themselves.

**Buyers and sellers, use the link above to verify where to redeem codes to ensure 4K codes redeem properly.**

**Feedback Logging (*Does not apply to GIVEAWAYS*)**

* Once a transaction has been completed, one user (buyer or seller) must create a comment (can be in-line with the deal discussion) tagging both `DCSbot` and the user they transacted with, for example  u\/messdup_a_aRon.
 * The u/ is required, and the username for the bot ***MUST BE TYPED NOT COPY/PASTED*** to work properly.
* Once this is done, the tagged user must respond to that comment for feedback to be logged.
* If successful, the bot will respond to the second comment with ""Added"", and the number will increment for both.

All discussions/negotiations about a potential transaction must be made via comments. Exchange codes/payment via PM or Reddit Chat. This helps to prevent scams and track trusted buyers and sellers.  **DO NOT RESPOND TO OFFERS MADE VIA PM OR CHAT.**

 * If you believe you have been scammed, please [fill out this form](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=r/digitalcodesell&amp;subject=I%20Think%20I%20Have%20Been%20Scammed&amp;message=*%20Username%20of%20the%20person%20scamming%20me:%20%0D%0A%0D%0A*%20Link%20to%20the%20thread%20where%20the%20transaction%20originated:%20%0D%0A%0D%0A*%20Link%20to%20screenshots%20uploaded%20to%20imgur%20of%20my%20conversations%20with%20the%20scammer:%20%0D%0A%0D%0A*%20An%20explanation%20of%20the%20situation:%20).

"smartwatch","t5_2u5ss","What are you on about? It is IP68 rated and has a water lock mode to block screen touches and pulse water out of the speaker when used properly. Waterproof and water resistant are really misleading to people. Why get sued over a guarantee?  Waterproof things are like jackets, tarps with hydrophobic coatings, Rain-x; things water pills and balls up on. Every thing else is just water resistant. Even a Rolex is only water *resistant* up to thousands of meters but you can technically dive further so they don't say waterproof as there is still a chance of failure. But water resistant to IPX8 means immersion in 3 feet of water for 30 minutes. If you need to swim or shower longer than that, I'm not sure what you're really looking for. Im sure they mention the sweat because that's what can cause the burning and shiny skin I see a lot of complaints about, although they'd never admit that. Because I've worn mine in the shower multiple times on accident, noticed, and then cleaned it without even having the water lock feature on; no issues. When I have to be out in the rain or if I do go swimming I use the water lock and who wants to get all pruny and be in the river for an hour anyway.

They do operate for more than 4.5 hours per day. 4.5hrs is just how long they do service desk stuff...the rest of the time is actually fixing the issues that people brought in during those 4.5 hours. If they did 6hrs of service desk stuff, you'd see greatly increased processing times on things because they wouldn't have enough time remaining to actually do their job vs waiting on the customer wanting them to explain how an LES works.  

I've only used the portal once (because I couldn't access it at my final active duty assignment) as a civilian, and they answered the question I had in less than 2 hours from submission. It would've literally taken me longer to drive to base, wait to be waited on, and ask my question, get an answer, and drive home, than it did to type out my question and wait for a response.  

Sure, not all problems will be solved that quickly, but in all the times I went into finance while on active duty none of my problems were ever solved while I was in the office....I still had to wait for them to process everything and then wait for my next check to make sure it was done right.",1651363262

But the father, who also dealt with lifelong trauma, discovered in his warped perception after an argument that the only way for his family to no longer suffer, would be to end all of their lives in a house fire? But the protagonist was away on a trip out of state, and the horrible act took place so abruptly that it had to happen *right then* for them to be at peace?

With the ending left ambiguous as to whether or not the protagonist was able to leave the troubles of the past behind, for their own sake, or if they gradually succumbed to the trauma overtaking them.

Eu posso fazer uma lista imensa de todas as cagadas que o PT fez e que ajudou a nos colocar nessa situação calamitosa que é a eleição mais desesperada que já presenciamos ou participamos. Eu posso te fazer uma lista de todas as situações nas quais nós e vários outros estivemos dispostos a instigar ainda mais a insatisfação popular com o Bozo -- o que resultaria, no fim das contas, em inquestionável vantagem eleitoral pro PT --, mas o PT fez tudo para impedir isso. Inclusive a p#@$ da militância do PT fazendo campanha difamatória contra companheira nossa, pq é mais fácil para eles instigar a militância contra alvo fraco do que partir pra cima do oponente político que tá com o poder nas mãos.   


Ou da vez em que outra companheira nossa levou porrada da militância do PT em manifestação só por estar lá.  


Sabe hooligans cujas fotos e prints vazaram, com socos ingleses, dizendo que iam matar anarquistas no Rio de Janeiro? Eu fui um dos caras ameaçados por eles.  


Quando o Lula botou exército no Complexo do Alemão, todo dia eu passava por lá e via aquilo. O mesmo exército que o Lula botou na Providência para agradar o Crivella e que acabaram sequestrando e matando gente de lá. Igual o Freixo querer meu voto agora junto com o Raul Jungmann depois desse corno ter mandado o exército intervir na minha cidade e pôr um tanque blindado na porta da minha casa.  


Não dá! Vocês querem culpar os indivíduos, enquanto com um dos maiores partidos de massa do mundo, fazendo umas práticas políticas toscas e contraproducentes, é uma injustiça do cacete! Se o PT perder, a culpa é dele, mesmo, que quando teve todas as chances de fazer o necessário pra vencer, foram lá e fizeram m3rd4.

1) Elisabet would not (and did not) have fled with her. Her last act was to save other alphas and walk off to die alone, saving the people who enabled her vision. She was the opposite of what Tilda thought.

2) she called Beta an inferior copy. Infuriating and cruel and revealed the real reason (as noted) she cut her off. Beta was smart enough to keep things quiet if asked. Horrible but very true revelation that it absolutely was grooming. Ew. But also, she didn’t see how awesome and capable Beta was. She did all that stuff earlier to help while being tortured and tied to a chair.

3) Aloy she saw as Elisabet reborn, and would eventually be the exact hand groomed copy she wanted another chance with. She even said “you’ll forgive me in a hundred years”. She with her immortality would work tirelessly to make Aloy into the immortal Elisabet.",1651363263

That said, like Stephen, if he doesn’t think you are on his level, he can be, or come off as, very arrogant. I definitely pushed Greg’s buttons at a festival once by allowing a opening band to start a pit on stage where SUNN’s gear was set up and surprisingly he didn’t lose his temper when we avoided disaster. 

All that said, Greg is also a cold hearted businessman and that has only been reinforced since Dave Grohl invested a bunch into Southern Lord. Greg has a nice house and cars and shit now, so he has to keep the wheels moving and I know that rubs some people the wrong way when he puts money before bands.

Honestly, you don't have to have any finance experience before applying, you just have to have the drive to learn on the fly and push yourself at the beginning. It's as simple as: you get out what you put in. I have friends who put 10 hours into it and friends that only put in one hour, they're all doing fine. You should probably put some serious time into the application and interviews though.

The point of all three of these clubs is really to help you get the job you want. In COINS, yeah we place the most Hokies on Wall Street but we've also placed in aerospace, defense contracting, software engineering, IT, quant finance, risk management, and we almost had someone place enterprise architecture, of all things. At the end of the day though, it's an investment club, so you have to be prepared to be into that a little bit. 

Also it doesn't hurt to talk to us during the recruiting events in the Fall, that also helps you stand out.",1651363265

"hondafit","t5_2vc0t","So I drove a 2nd gen 1.3 yesterday and it's pretty good.

Couple thoughts.

- 1.3 seems generally peppy in city driving but when I tried to get it to ""kick down"" it seemed to just rev higher without much more acceleration.  

- The CVT feels a bit like a slipping auto, but that's probably just something to get used to.

- The seats are oddly shaped. Like the back bolster is to high up and is pushing me forward. I don't know if just my bad posture or a thing for other people too. When I sat in something like a Yaris it was totally fine.

Also, I found a brochure that said 1st gen Jazz in Australia came with a auto instead of a CVT. Is there any way to know what kind of transmission is fitted through the Vin or option plate?

If I could get a 1st gen with a 1.5 without the CVT, that would probably work well enough for me.",1651363265

&gt; AME3302. BUENOS AIRES (ARGENTINA), 09/12/2021.- El ex ministro de economía Domingo Cavallo habla durante una entrevista con Efe el 7 de diciembre de 2021, en Buenos Aires (Argentina). El exministro de Economía argentino Domingo Cavallo (1991-1996 y 2001) todavía mantiene su defensa a ultranza del ""corralito"", como se conoció a las restricciones decretadas en diciembre de 2001 para retirar dinero de los bancos. EFE/ Juan Ignacio Roncoroni 
&gt; 
&gt; “A pesar de la continuidad de la reactivación económica post pandemia, h**asta 2024 la suerte económica está echada. La economía no va a mejorar, pero si puede empeorar. Y mucho”.**
&gt; 
&gt; Tal la primera fase del reciente posteo de Domingo Cavallo en su sitio en internet, que tituló: “Que la inflación anual no supere el 80% es lo máximo a lo que puede aspirar este gobierno”.
&gt; 
&gt; El exministro de Economía basa su proyección en un “ejercicio de simulación”, a partir de suponer que el gobierno cumplirá las metas fiscal y monetaria del programa con el FMI, pero solo en términos del PBI, no en valores nominales, debido “al escenario inflacionario, tan volátil e imprevisible”.
&gt; 
&gt; De hecho, **Cavallo afirma que el gobierno no podrá cumplir con los supuestos de inflación con los que se elaboró el programa ni con la meta de acumulación de reservas en el Banco Central, pero supone que el Fondo otorgará las dispensas (waiver o perdón de metas) necesarias para evitar que la Argentina incurra en atrasos**.
&gt; 
&gt; Para lograr este escenario, el mejor al que el gobierno puede aspirar, dice Cavallo, deberá aumentar muy pronto el ritmo de devaluación oficial (a entre 4 y 5% mensual), elevar la tasa de interés del BCRA y también la que paga el Tesoro para colocar deuda interna, a no menos de 4,7% mensual, es decir 56% nominal anual o 73% efectiva anual.
&gt; 
&gt; **Tarifas**
&gt; 
&gt; Además, añade el creador de la convertibilidad, el gobierno deberá aumentar fuertemente las tarifas eléctricas, del gas y de transportes, para reducir los subsidios económicos un 0,8% del PBI respecto a lo gastado en 2021. Si no lo hiciera, deberá reducir la inversión pública o algún otro ítem del presupuesto.
&gt; 
&gt; El extenso posteo, con su apéndice de cuadros y gráficos, concluye que **si el gobierno cumple con todas las condicione, la inflación podría ubicarse en 72% anual a fin de año, pero podría superar perfectamente el 80% si se prolongan los desvíos que –dice- “ya se observan en el mes de abril”.**
&gt; 
&gt; Cavallo es lapidario acerca de las posibilidades del Ejecutivo de revertir o mejorar significativamente la actual situación. “Me resulta difícil imaginar que este gobierno consiga un mejor escenario alternativo, con Guzmán o con cualquier otro ministro de economía que pueda sustituirlo con el actual contexto político”.
&gt; 
&gt; En cambio, añade, “sí puedo imaginar resultados mucho peores si el cambio de ministro se hiciera para dar cabida a las ideas de quienes rodean a la Vicepresidenta”.
&gt; 
&gt; [Cavallo no elogia a Guzmán, pero advierte que la inflación sería mucho más alta si es desplazado por el kirchnerismo

&gt; 
&gt; **E la nave va**
&gt; 
&gt; Y todo esto a pesar de que Cavallo considera posible que continúe la recuperación del nivel de actividad, para cerrar 2022 con un aumento del 4% del PBI. Al respecto, cita varios indicadores, como el avance del 7,2% del Estimador Mensual de Actividad Económica (EMAE) en el primer bimestre, el aumento del 3,5% del “Índice general de Actividad (IGA) del estudio de Orlando Ferreres y el 3,2% del Índice de Actividad Industrial de FIEL del primer trimestre. Incluso citas datos aún más positivos, como los del índice Construya y los datos de producción de automóviles de Adefa, con un aumento del 17,7% en el primer trimestre.
&gt; 
&gt; Por otra parte, observa que la amplia diferencia entre el crecimiento de las ventas en Shoppings (36,8%) y en supermercados (4,9%) “seguramente refleja la mayor capacidad de compra de los estratos de ingresos altos y medio altos que complementan sus ingresos con desembolsos de ahorros anteriores en dólares para financiar los niveles de consumo a los que estaban acostumbrados antes de la pandemia”. Todo eso apunta, justifica, a un aumento del 4% del PBI, como publicó en su más reciente actualización el FMI.
&gt; 
&gt; Pero hay factores que pueden frustrar esas expectativas, dice Cavallo, en especial las restricciones a la importación de insumos para la industria y la escasez de gas y gasoil en el invierno que, no obstante, podrían ser compensadas por un mejor desempeño agropecuario, sector en el que –observa- “las estimaciones sobre perdidas de la producción de soja y de los cereales por las malas condiciones climáticas están siendo recortadas y las estimaciones de producción están aumentando”.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dolor inflación**
&gt; 
&gt; Mucho menos halagüeño, prosigue, es el panorama en materia de inflación, que promedia en un 5% mensual aunque cita que el salto de la inflación minorista de marzo del Indec fue mucho mayor, llegando al 6,7% en marzo y “en abril estaría apenas abajo del 6%”.
&gt; 
&gt; De allí e**l exministro proyecta la dinámica inflacionaria para el resto del año considerando cuatro factores: el ritmo de devaluación del dólar oficial, el aumento en la tasa de interés, su efecto sobre la brecha cambiaria con el mercado libre y la evolución de los salarios nominales.**
&gt; 
&gt; Del ritmo de devaluación nota que todavía está lejos de la tasa mensual de inflación y que, según lo acordado con el FMI, debería acercarse al 5% mensual, un aumento que –dice- “es claro que va a empujar a la tasa de inflación para arriba”. Al respecto, observa que mientras la tasa de devaluación cayó entre abril y noviembre de 2021, también lo hizo la tasa de inflación, pero desde diciembre, a medida que la devaluación fue aumentando de ritmo, también lo hizo la inflación, incluso más que el dólar. En su “simulación”, Cavallo asume que hasta fin de año el gobierno devaluará al 4,5% mensual, con el dólar aumentando el 60% en todo el año, lo que a su vez empujará la tasa de interés del BCRA (al 4,7% mensual), para reducir la brecha cambiaria, y la que deberá pagar el Tesoro, para financiar el déficit fiscal.
&gt; 
&gt; Allí Cavallo denuncia cierta lentitud del Banco Central, que deberá aumentar la tasa no solo para restarle atractivo al dólar, sino también para que el Tesoro pueda colocar suficiente deuda para atender sus vencimientos. Ya en abril, dice Cavallo, las colocaciones de Economía quedaron $ 106.000 millones por debajo de los vencimientos y los vencimientos de mayo son “bastante más altos que los de abril”.
&gt; 
&gt; [Según Cavallo, el BCRA demoró en aumentar la tasa y deberá ir más rápido, para contener la brecha cambiaria y para que el Tesoro pueda refinanciar los vencimientos, que en abril no logró cubrir y en mayo serán mucho más altos](https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/infobae/OZXAN5FPDNGDRB6LHVZKDSYXOA.jpg)
&gt; 
&gt; Según Cavallo, el BCRA demoró en aumentar la tasa y deberá ir más rápido, para contener la brecha cambiaria y para que el Tesoro pueda refinanciar los vencimientos, que en abril no logró cubrir y en mayo serán mucho más altos
&gt; 
&gt; **Salarios**
&gt; 
&gt; En cuanto a salarios, Cavallo recuerda que cada vez que se trató de recuperar el ritmo de aumento de los salarios, la inflación terminó aumentando y deteriorando el salario real. Por eso, cree, en los próximos 12 meses los salarios perderán con la inflación.
&gt; 
&gt; De las cuentas fiscales destaca la importancia de reducir los subsidios en 0,8 % del PBI, que se lograría “con el aumento de los precios de la electricidad, el gas y los transportes”.

"argentina","t5_2qlht","&gt; Allí el exministro lanza una advertencia: “**si, por oposición de la vicepresidenta, no se logra aumentar los precios de la energía como para producir esta reducción de los subsidios económicos, el gobierno no tendrá otra alternativa que recurrir al rubro gastos de capital”, esto es la inversión pública, que es lo que más demanda el kirchnerismo y dice querer defender el gobierno de Alberto Fernández.**
&gt; 
&gt; Mucho más difícil sería reducir el gasto en jubilaciones o en programas sociales, dice Cavallo, antes de concluir que “es posible que la meta fiscal del 2,5% del PBI como porcentaje del PBI pueda ser cumplida”.
&gt; 
&gt; También considera “cumplible” la meta monetaria, si se aumenta lo suficiente la tasas de interés, aunque cree que esto no bastará para atraer más depósitos a plazo fijo, que estima se reducirán de 14,6 a 12% del PBI.
&gt; 
&gt; Lo que el Gobierno no podrá cumplir, según Cavallo, es la meta de acumulación de reservas, teniendo en cuenta que el superávit comercial se reducirá de USD 15.000 a 12.000 millones a menos que el gobierno restrinja las importaciones más de lo que está haciendo actualmente. “De hacerlo, se comprometería mucho el proceso de reactivación de la economía y el crecimiento del PBI**.** **Teniendo en cuenta que ese crecimiento es el único resultado positivo que el gobierno puede mostrar de su gestión económica, no cabe esperar que lo vaya a resignar”.**
&gt; 
&gt; De ahí la estimación de una inflación de base del 72% anual, que podría aumentar e incluso desmadrarse si hay nuevos episodios de inestabilidad política y tienen cabida, como pone Cavallo, “las ideas de quienes rodean a la Vicepresidenta”.

The consensus seems to be RP2+ is more powerful (and definitely has better default firmware), but I am really partial to the 351V because of the form factor (as you seem to be as well).  The GBC was my first console, and so simply looking at the 351V is a shot of instant nostalgia.

The RP2+ will take a long time to ship, so I put in a pre-order for it, and bought the 351V from a local dealer, it arrived yesterday. Will probably use the 351V, then put on display when the RP2+ arrives. If in the next few days I'm satisfied enough with the 351V that I don't think I want a second hand-held, I'll just cancel my RP2+ pre-order (through droix).",1651363268

Sometimes it does. I do it with adults. I work in IT. If they call me as their internet isn't working and their DNS settings are set incorrectly for whatever reason and I fix that. When they ask what's wrong I'm not going to say ""your hostnames you were trying to reach weren't being resolved as the DNS server set in your ipv4 section wasn't pointing to a DNS server. I'll say ""They part of the PC that turns [facebook.com](https://facebook.com) into it's real address was broken and I've fixed that"". If they want me to explain further to the point that i did above, we can work to that explaining hostnames, what IP addresses are, what DNS is etc (other than I won't as I have work to do and don't have time).

When you teach kids that tree's make oxygen at age 7, you might want to wait a few years until you really get into photosynthesis when you've gone over elements and stuff.

&gt;Well, some children are more intelligent and some are less intelligent, they are individuals but most of them are able to weigh the good and the bad and decide what to do based on that

Which is why kids get taught differently based on their skill level. We have special school, gifted schools and classes might be split for the different levels of kids. Ideally they get 1:1 education and we can asses what they can and can't decide. But we live in the real world and good luck getting that set up. Fundings, staffing etc. 

&gt;Yes but if it's something life changing they should be involved except if the parent knows that the child doesn't have the cognitive abilities obviously

Most kids aren't there yet. Older ones like 16 and 17, maybe. They're getting there and are already getting to make those decisions like what to do after school etc.",1651363268

Also anyone who locked into a fixed deal will not be selling their house and anyone who isn’t will fix asap or will sit tight until the prices come back up again. The housing stock will be in even shorter supply because no one in their right mind would sell and get into negative equity unless there was a damn good reason ie I’m being kicked out.

Texas is a good program historically and some times really good. But it is not great. I don’t know how you could view Texas as anything other than one of the most underachieving football programs if not the most underachieving. 

1. Most profitable university in the world 
2. Premier college in the biggest football state in the US 
3. Gigantic fan base 
4. The most donors of any team 
5. The list goes on and on 

How can you not view it as anything other than underachieving? Winning 3 conference championships in 25 years with our resources.

Rarely when they are, there’s always backup bulbs to fix real quick, we’re never on major highways but you can’t have a trailer with no lights driving down the road.

"vanderpumprules","t5_302zw","When I was in Vegas I was scrolling Reddit as one does, and when I realized from this sub that Lisa Vanderpump had just opened a new restaurant I was so excited to check it out! I’ve never been to a cool new restaurant like this in its first week of being open.

I had been to the Vanderpump cocktail garden at Caesar’s before- that one is more of a drinks and apps place, it was cute but nothing amazing. I’ve never been to any of the WeHo Vanderpump places so can’t speak to those. Compared to the cocktail garden though, Vanderpump à Paris was so much better! I think it helps that they are a full restaurant so there’s a lot more food choices. And the service was sooo much better. Our waiter was so friendly, helpful, and really made us feel special and like it was a fancy vibe even though we didn’t feel fancy at all lol.

Oh and most importantly- the goat cheese cakes at Vanderpump à Paris are a million times better than the goat cheese balls at the vanderpump cocktail garden. The goat cheese cakes were huge whereas the balls were truly tiny balls. The rest of the food was really good too, we got a variety of things to share and the portions were much better than the tiny cocktail garden portions so we couldn’t even finish it all. Only tried one drink and I’m a lightweight so I couldn’t even finish it lol but it was very tasty and big. Vegas is really expensive for food and drinks, for Vegas I thought for the food, drink, and experience it was all totally worth it. 

If it had been a longer trip I totally would’ve gone again because there were so many other things on the menu that sounded good to try. There’s also some other cool spots in the restaurant to get photo ops for fans or just aesthetic vibes, like a big red piano which might get used on certain nights not sure, and a big artsy portrait of Lisa Vanderpump

The food and drinks were actually good, and a fair value for Vegas, the ambience was so nice and the service was great, I’d recommend checking this out even for non VPR fans, which I wouldn’t necessarily say about the Vanderpump cocktail garden which was cool but ultimately only okay. For VPR fans I would definitely say to check it out if you’re in Vegas! It’s so fun to eat at the places connected to the show we watch, and there’s lots of fun details all around",1651363270
"truscum","t5_3g2n6","Being trans is a medical issue.

For the trenders:
Sometimes I think that this is a psyop to influence people to be trans en mass so that they can swing the pendulum back to the far right by claiming extremism in the far left and the impressionable youth are falling for it. Which is why it's also considered cool to be a communist in extreme leftist spaces. (unless I'm wrong, just observations)

What's the best way to get control over something when rights are usually protected and defended?

By letting it get out of control so it becomes a public issue.",1651363270

* Both dislike their powers (Viper believing his Septima has never been any use to him and Denji fearing his devil powers are making him emotionless)
* Both were specifically found by the leader of an organization (Nova with the Sumeragi Seven and Makima with the Devil Hunters) due to their powers to have them join an organization
* Both characters fight for the sake of someone else's affection (Joule and Makima), despite that person clearly not being into them, even joining an organization (Sumeragi and Public Safety Devil Hunters) to get closer to them
* In their search for this person's affection, they lost a lot (Viper was forced to put his Septima into a glaive and basically be a tool for Sumeragi, while Denji became Makima's slave)",1651363271

They've tried to make plans that imploded a few times in the past few months (covid and family emergencies), and timing finally worked yesterday, so I was excited for it, just stressed because shit was a disaster and didn't think we'd pull it off in time. 

His friend is actually fantastic. We pulled off getting the living room and basement in order beforehand, which was a relief, and his buddy actually helped me sort out some of the box chaos and the kitchen, and offered to come help us move the last of it Sunday.

He did help me undisaster, and got groceries and cooked dinner. Now we just need to undisaster the rest of it that we finished bringing today again.",1651363271

"picrequests","t5_2scp1","[Shadow and cutouts removed. Also upscaled and image quality upped a bit.](https://i.imgur.com/ysRbE1U.jpg)

There's no ""simple"" way to remove a shadow on a face like this. Basically you paint it away so for a good result you have to be somewhat good at painting (in this case) a realistic face since that's kinda what you're doing. No quick one click solution, just manual work where the more time you spend on it the better the result will be.

Here's some more details if you (or anyone else) are genuinly interested in the workflow (in Photoshop):

For stuff like this I like to do a frequency separation and then use curve layers on the low frequency layers to do an initial fix. And then a second pass to fix colors and smooth out stuff with the mixer brush. There's always a bit of back and forth since nothing is really simple:) Some ai stuff to upscale and enhance details and a bit of grain (and a tiny, tiny bit of chromatic abberation) on top to make it feel a bit more analog. Probably missed something but that's about it:)",1651363272

As it is, nothing was stopping Justine when she got out to going to the police and telling them how some psycho has been keeping her in his closet for months now. Even *if* Wesley is able to prove that she is the one who slit his throat, that’s not really going to matter when he’s facing kidnapping and human abuse crimes. And what, exactly, is the group going to do? Even if they were still 100% with him, they can’t exactly break Wes out of prison for heinous crimes he actually committed. And what do you think that would do to their relationships with him, to know what he’s capable of? 

As someone else said, the whole thing exists solely to show how tough and badass Wesley has become, but in reality it’s a cheap move the writers couldn’t back up that just makes him look like a total psycho.

&gt; And where else in your normal life are you actually “scientific”? 

Most things have some science to them, like when driving in a car, the measurements have to be precise to know how fast you're going. An atheist that tried to guess how fast they were traveling could get into trouble.

&gt; You haven’t answered the question of when we should use the “adoptive father”

I gave an example above, like if there is a hospital visit. Perhaps there is an organ donation, so it would be important to tell the staff that they are not blood relatives. Pretending they were could lead to problems (i.e. organ rejection).

&gt; So what justifies your use of a scientific viewpoint anyway when your own religion is so loose with the term?

I think I'm pretty clear that the physical body comes from earth and the ethereal spirit comes from heaven.",1651363273

I no longer feel the pressure to conform to, and be under the subjugation of, a rigid set of traditional expectations and laws laid out by a human-led organization.  'Christian freedom' is priceless and I wouldn't trade it for anything.

Realizing that I can develop a personal relationship with my Creator and his only begotten son through my *own* accord without worrying or stressing over regular meeting attendance, going door to door every weekend, turning in monthly service reports, and preparing parts, is both refreshing and reassuring.  This is what Jesus meant in Matthew 11:28-30.

We are saved, *not* by works, but by God's undeserved kindness and grace.

4 - I started writing longhand Blake’s Seven and Doctor Who fic when I was in primary school, so probably around 1989, posted my first fic to a zine in 1992 (it didn’t get accepted!) and first one online in about 2002 or 2003. Can’t actually remember exactly.

The architect, Luigi Vietti, did a lot of design work in Porto Cervo. [This link](https://www.porto-cervo-realestate.com/old/costasmeralda/eng/Vietti.htm) has some information.

Karim's residence is the Cerbiatte Villas. 

&gt; His first and most important works were the Village of Porto Cervo and the Cerbiatte villas, where the Aga Khan was to choose as his residence.

Not sure if he owns it all, but it looks huge:
https://imgur.com/a/WlYVAJj

Vietti apparently had some affiliation with the Italian Fascists:

&gt; Luigi Vietti was born in Cannobio. Already as a young architect, he designed many buildings used by Mussolini’s Fascist government as symbols of his political movement. 

https://insubricahistorica.ch/blog/2019/05/18/rationalist-sometimes-called-fascist-architecture-on-shores-of-lake-maggiore/

"depression_help","t5_2zy2x","no. don't stop making commitments. drag yourself out of bed no matter how hard it is. without commitments you'll be dragging yourself out of bed less and less and it's only going to make you feel worse.

as for medications not working I'd suggest looking into other kinds of treatments:

Therapy/Mindfulness

Electro Convulsive Therapy

esketamine/spravado

Trans-cranial Magnetic Stimulation

Guided psychadelic trip programs (or if you go the illegal route, there are apps that can help you walk through a trip, just start small and be careful)

and of course if you haven't already, you should do regular blood tests every few months to look for deficiencies. pretty much all the usual vitamin deficiencies can cause or worsen depression. keeping up with those might not cure you but it makes depression a lot worse if you don't. personally i get vitamin D and B deficiencies every few months.

look into healthier diets. even if you are getting everything you generally need from your diet, your ""gut health"" is very important and has been scientifically linked to depression.

lastly, stay in good physical shape. again this won't cure you but it helps a lot.

edit: again with the commitments, obviously if you aren't sure you can go and have a good reason then don't say you can. but being depressed isn't a good reason. again because it will make you feel worse if you don't stay active.

idk about others here but personally i feel like a piece of shit if i spend all day sleeping even if i didn't have social commitments that day.

edit 2: im also happy to discuss in detail any of the treatments i listed if you are curious.",1651363276

"JordanPeterson","t5_32jqy","""from watching several hours worth of videos, JP seems to put alot of emphasis on your place in the hierarchy more or less determines your happiness""

I think you may be inferring an incorrect conclusion. Form my understanding JP makes the case that pursuing meaning is what brings joy to life and makes suffering tolerable. Also, I would not say that being Conscientious is a factor for general success, although it certainly has a high prediction for monetary success. Being high in conscientiousness may lead to higher income but if your neither industrious or conscientious trying to force yourself into roles that demand Conscientious traits will make you miserable.

I score in the bottom 1% of conscientiousness on the big 5. When I was a teenager id have clothes and trash from food piled up above my ankles in my room, I now have to make the conscious decision to be cleanly in particular situations I am not more of a cleanly person I just have just built some habits that would normally be attributed to a cleanly person if that makes sense.

It’s not my understanding that you can become more Conscientious however you can habituate the same behaviors as people who are high in Conscientiousness through routine or by focusing on one habit at a time.

Your place in a hierarchy has and effect on your serotonin levels which can affect your mood, however this does not mean you cannot pursue meaningful and fulfilling activities outside of a hierarchy. It may be useful for you to determine what you find meaningful and pursue that, it doesn’t seem obvious this has to be a hierarchal endeavor. Finding meaning outside of monetary success and systematic hierarchies is a perfectly valid endeavor.

When JP refers to hierarchy, given the context I assume that JP is talking about how behavioral patterns and how we organize our society is not arbitrary but rather deeply rooted in biology, it is not to say you cannot live a meaningful life in spite of not being high in conscientiousness. I hope this helps and I am more than willing to offer a rebuttal if you have one yourself.",1651363277

"kindle","t5_2qudz","Hope you’re enjoying your time. One little thing though….

The Potomac River was deeply embroiled in slavery. This is especially true of many cities built along its banks. Basically, Black slaves were imported to build these cities and they traveled along the Potomac River to get to their destinations.

I bring this up because you might want to think about this as you travel the area, that you are visiting and enjoying a region built upon the blood of Black slaves.

More than just a moment of silent thanks to them for the privilege you now enjoy, you might consider donating to marginalized communities who still live in those areas (some of them direct descendants of those who were slaves there).

A particularly nice donation might even be a Kindle! :) marginalized communities have lower rates of literacy due to the disparate impact of funding for schools. 

This would be doubly useful for them because they would be able to acquire books that tell them about the history of slaves on the Potomac. They deserve to know their history just as much as you now do, so a kindle would be appreciated.

Here is some scholarly reading that you might enjoy to learn about the ritual history of the area you’re currently traveling:

I'd still rather be injured in that way than \*raped\* (and I believe I'd used rape as an example). Not to mention, aside from being stabbed or raped, having to deal with someone on drugs or in crisis when you're barely awake in the morning shouldn't be the norm. It causes stress. My brother did security for Trimet for years, and I've used public transit, and it does not meet my comfort level. If I HAD TO use it I would (in fact, a CA study showed that 89% of public transit users would use a car if they could, so it's not about saving the earth for many, it's that the poor don't have the luxury of a choice).

That said, I'm VERY concerned about climate chaos and would love to see how we can make public transit free/cheaper, faster, and safer so we can incentivize people to WANT to use it. It's problematic to me that the solutions always demand the poor bear the brunt of climate action as they get phased out of car usage, while the rich will do whatever is convenient.

But yeah it's a big ask to ask someone to donate a kidney. Personally if the roles were reversed I wouldn't.

"RepTime","t5_37dr6","Why the personal attack on Lykanjt? Jealous hes a TD or something? I dont understand? Your bitching about prices? VSF DJ are out of stock everywhere! Small limited runs of VSF are being assembled. And other TD has raised there prices as well. I highly doubt hes making $300 on a watch.  Maybe $50 to $75 mark up? But not $300.. That's bullshit and not true!! Hes sold me watches at regular TD prices before and overnight it to me as well?? 

Keep in mind hes buying through a TD. Which means hes paying TD premium prices already. These TD are in it for the money. So I highly doubt hes getting much of a discount for multiple watch purchases. Then they are QC processing for each watch. Then there are a huge risk importing multiple watches to get past customs.
This kind of shipping is very expensive and has to be done in such a way for it to get past customs. Or he loses thousands of dollars. (Big gamble! High risk playing this game!) This kind of operation is very coordinated and planned out. 
And takes a substantial amount of time &amp; money dealing with orders, TD, and answering messages of broken up english for hours. And making sure all orders go to the right address. Sending watches out to watchmakers to fix any issues that might happen. Hours of organizing. Not to mention prices are fluctuating everyday in the rep market. 

I have personally looked in to doing this myself.  And theres no way I have time to run a operation like he runs. And still run my own business. To time consuming with little reward for the time hes spending making sure everything runs smoothly. And making sure you get a good quality rep piece that isnt DOA.. You have no ideal how much work that hes doing behind the scenes. 

I have personally bought multiple pieces from lykanjt. And I'm a picky SOB. And he humbley puts up with me. And makes sure I get the correct watch I ordered. And i gladly pay premium or mark up for his services. And he is my personal TD. His services are very convenient and fast for the money you pay. And most of all. No customs risk.. I'm very happy hes is a TD. Something we needed here in the conus for years. 

What other TD you know in the USA that can custom order any rep watch you want. Go through all the trouble. And take all the risk getting it to you in the timeframe he does?? That's right you dont. You dont have to order from Lykanjt either. You can order from other TD and wait 3 to 4 months for your DOA rep!

Its called supply and demand 😀

Trusty time prices at $758 before shipping. Not to mention the $35 to $45 in shipping cost. And Trusty legendary QC practice.

If things are truly unwell even some middle class members could join the revolt.  It's generally antithesis to neoliberalism because the revolutionaries will want to replace the current order with theoretical systems such as communism and socialism.

Strip chat even patronisingly explained to me how I should accept piracy. They’re too lazy to find a better way to advertise their cam sites then letting random criminals use their pop ups and banners on the most low life websites on the web, what kind of customers does that bring in I wonder 🙄. We need to focus more attention on holding cam sites accountable for their affiliations to piracy sites and cut off a major income stream to these scum bag leeches. Start hassling the cam sites, tweet them, email them, make a stink! It is absolutely astonishing that these cam sites bank roll criminals who harass and steal from the models that make them money. More needs to be done and it won’t get done unless we get angry, get mobilised and start speaking up for ourselves. Don’t wait for the dudes that own any of these sites to care about anything other than money, they treat the cam community like an abusive pimp, let’s change that, the law is on our side.

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","&gt;The Amnesty Report began with Sheikh Jarrah in which the residents refused to pay rent.

You're still not actually addressing anything in the report.

https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2022/02/israels-system-of-apartheid/

Here's what Amnesty International states:

* Fragmentation into domains of control - At the heart of the system is keeping Palestinian separated from each other into distinct territorial, legal and administrative domains

* Dispossession of land and property - Decades of discriminatory land and property seizures, home demolitions and forced evictions

* Segregation and control - A system of laws and policies that keep Palestinians restricted to enclaves, subject to several measures that control their lives, and segregated from Jewish Israelis

* Deprivation of economic &amp; social rights - The deliberate impoverishment of Palestinians keeping them at great disadvantage in comparison to Jewish Israelis

Do you dispute any of these points that are actually made by AI here?

&gt;The Btselem report doesn't bother to differentiate citizens and non-citizens which is a pretty big problem.

But when the government deliberately denies citizenship to a group and restricts their voting rights specifically to take advantage of them, surely that should be factored in? What you're saying would be like saying that black people in the American South in the 1840s shouldn't have their human rights situation considered because they're non-citizens and they shouldn't expect to have an inherent right to citizenship to a country that doesn't want to give them citizenship.

&gt;The Human Rights Watch site still calls Gaza 'occupied' even though it hasn't been for a while. If that error was made, that throws shade on everything

The Gaza Strip is not sovereign though. Israel controls their land, sea, and air, as well as their borders. I mean Israel limits goods that can enter the Gaza Strip to such an extent that the calories per person are counted. And because they are totally controlled by Israel in this way, it counts as an occupation. It would be like saying that the Warsaw Ghetto wasn't occupied by nazis because technically the only inhabitants were Jews.

&gt;I'm not interested in changing your mind, your mind is made up.

Why do you think my mind is made up? To me, my mind is ""made up"" because of the overwhelming evidence that supports my position. I've yet to see you present ANY evidence that supports your position. Like, none. You've spent this back-and-forth spending almost all of the time with ad hominems and poisoning the well and just saying that any source I bring up is biased or isn't impartial.",1651363284

Now drop the books in the following order, waiting exactly 4 seconds between each drop, earth, air, fire, water. Lastly, find a beachzone in realm, can’t be a key, and solo it.

There is no critical failure on a Strike. Rolling a 1 is *usually* a miss (rare exceptions where even a 1 is still 10+ above the AC) but it's *only* a miss.

The main reason crit fails are terrible is that they scale *inversely* with competence - rolling more attacks in a round make you *more* likely to stab yourself in the foot or whatever idiotic thing the GM decides.

I will concede that there *are* crit failure/success card decks available from Paizo. They're shit and no one should buy them ever, but they're fortunately not part of the core system.",1651363285

"ProgrammerHumor","t5_2tex6","C doesn't necessarily allow for that type of behavior. Instead it allow for arrays of pointers (void*) which would just mean a collection of addresses that you would need to deduce to their type somewhere else in code. C++ allows for arrays of abstract classes and interfaces, of course, but that's just telling the compiler that you promise to implement the method definitions defined in the interface for it to call from. At its core, C# does the same thing in that to utilize an object as if it were another type of object, you need to cast it which happens at runtime and is liable to throw runtime exceptions or become a null value.
JavaScript uses prototypical OOP while the other languages are classical OOP. You can imitate the behavior but to say they allow for arrays of different types is inaccurate. They allow for arrays of the same type but you have to deduce what they are dynamically later.",1651363286

"mentalhealth","t5_2qirg","How do you see dyed hair as the same exact thing as a nurse showing up with yellow reptile like colored contacts to work a shift on the psychiatric floor in this situation ?! 

FFS really?! 

The yellow contacts can create anyone whose possible already struggling with visual hallucinations or even on the verge of having an episode of psychosis &amp; this can be what pushes them over the edge. Where as: in real life I believe no matter who you are or where you live you’ve definitely been primed before by seeing at least on a television if not in public [if not] someone who you may personally know in real life who has by 2022 at the VERY LEAST: dyed their hair. [ESPECIALLY if they have dyed it a semi natural color that’s just different from their exact hair color.. And I feel like we can safely include in here that tattoos &amp; piercings to a certain extent - not over done, because at the end of the day we are professionals but my god it’s 2022.] 

I have THREE doctorates and my hair is purple. And I have both arms tattooed to 3/4 sleeves as well as my septum pierced. And I have am a specialist in veterinary medicine &amp; science - as well as shelter medicine. On top of a Veterinary Surgeon who specializes in the most difficult anesthesia cases that your normal veterinarian is not skilled enough to operate on. So when your dog, or cat, even some exotics.. have underlying health conditions making them high risks for anesthesia but they need a life saving procedure. Guess who you’re vet’s sending you to see? MY TATTOOED &amp; PIERCED, PURPLE HAIRED SELF. 

SOO, This woman is clearly not utilizing her brain because she is already working with at risk patients, who you need to ensure that you aren’t wearing anything obnoxious color or scent wise, on top of the fact that they need to be in a stable environment. So working as a traveling nurse, already makes you stick out like a sore thumb when you’re working with clients who need a strict routine &amp; stability in their daily lives. But to add to that making such a weird choice - I’m curious to hear if she was spoken to about her brilliant decision to stand out like a sore thumb on the psych ward unit ?? 

Do you happen to recall if she was reprimanded or not, lady?! Because this story is literally just so surreal to me.",1651363286
"antitheistcheesecake","t5_56ml5q","&gt; but under the definition of choice

Well let me say this : i decided to eat chicken today for many of the reasons you gave last time (been a while, etc.). However i will eat beef despite not wanting beef, just to prove your hypothesis wrong. In this case, didn't i clearly make my own choice?

&gt; To that end, I employed the previous wager to show that the soundness of your claim is in question due to the improbability of the premise of God’s trustworthiness, and therefore it is not only less plausible when compared to not only all competing working theories of reality

Yes when i was saying which proof do you have. It was for this part  specifically. Which proof do you have to back the claim on which you made the wager. The only thing we know from God is what was revealed by religion. So where in the Torah, New Testament or Quran can you base your premise about God wanting to trick us and send us all to hell.

&gt; so how can we be sure in the trustworthiness of a religion?

Estás joven, no te apresures y si nunca has tenido novia, debes saber el por qué para mejorar ese aspecto, conocer a muchas chicas, ser cuidadoso con quién te involucras porque te puede traer demasiados problemas y ser más sociable, pero sobre todo debes tener mucha inciativa, autoestima y ser muy tolerable al rechazo.

"giftcardexchange","t5_2s989","Hello, by trading here you agree that your post follows all of the [**GCX Rules**](https://www.reddit.com/r/giftcardexchange/wiki/rules). If you have not read these, stop and do so now. Here's a condensed list that is absolutely essential to read before you move any further.

* Rule 1: DO NOT accept PMs without a public comment on GCX! Open your post and ensure you can see the comment. If you can't, don't engage with the user as they may be attempting to trick you by disguising a PM as a public comment. Was your post removed and someone immediately sent you a private message? Don't talk with them! Search the [**Universal Scammer List**](https://universalscammerlist.com/search.php). Did you receive a PM from modmail saying you can't sell the gift card on the sub, but you can sell it to the mod team? This is a scam! The mods of /r/giftcardexchange will never offer this ""service"" or ask you to reveal gift card information! Click on the sub name - it's likely a private sub named ""gitfcardexchange"" or ""giftcardexcharge"" attempting to impersonate the real /r/giftcardexchange.
* Rule 2: Investigate your trading partner! Is the account very inactive? Did they just become active and immediately start posting on trade subs? Are they trying to direct you off of Reddit to another site? These are red flags! Double check any links you're sent and ensure they aren't leading to a different domain outside of Reddit.
* Rules 4 and 5: Are you attempting to trade an account balance such as Amazon gift card balance over $250 in value? Are you attempting to trade a single gift card or multiple gift cards over $250 in value? Stop and see the appropriate rule and send in the form to modmail, otherwise your post will be removed and you'll receive an infraction.
* Rule 6: Do you have a prepaid card such as Visa? These cannot be traded for cash equivalents such as PayPal here! GCX is for trading gift cards - see /r/Cash4Cash if it is more appropriate.
* Rule 11: Are you selling a gift card? If you're a ``GCX Beginner`` you can only ask for PayPal Goods &amp; Services! Asking for any other payment method (not including gift cards) will lead to a post removal.

"redscarepod","t5_hq6n1","Right, that's what I mean about higher standards. You're picky in your own way. I'm the same, I love cooking &amp; baking but Im underweight, always have been. I love new flavors and making food, but often cooking still feels like a huge undertaking that's easy for me to put off and be fine, it's super easy for me to just be like oh I'll eat later. Feels like no big deal. But I've been around other people who 2 hrs post our last meal start crying about how theyre starving. They aren't, they've adapted themselves to indulging their hunger the moment it strikes. 

I said in another comment, imo, genetically or physically speaking, whatever mechanism that is theoretically mildly malfunctioning in you and causing you to be slightly underweight, could also be the culprit in what causes other people to be slightly overweight and struggle with their food intake. That's obviously not the only reason, lots of people making good points here, but I had a feeling this is the kind of info u want? It's pretty complicated &amp; it's more research oriented investigative stuff, not necessarily something that would be revealed to you in a CBC or thyroid panel.",1651363288

"buildapcsales","t5_2s3dh","Be mindful of recent listings of in-demand products from suspicious third-party sellers on marketplaces such as Amazon, eBay, Google, Newegg, and Walmart. These ""deals"" have a high likelihood of not shipping; you should do your due diligence to ensure you do not get scammed. 

* Use common sense - if the deal seems too good to be true, it probably is.
* Check seller profiles for signs that the sale may be fraudulent. 
    * The seller is new or has few reviews. 
    * The seller has largely negative reviews (on Amazon, sellers can remove negative reviews from their ratings- viewing seller profiles allows you to see these complaints) 
    * The seller has a recently reactivated account (likely their account was hacked and is now being used fraudulently). 

If you suspect a deal is fraudulent, please report the post. Moderators can take action based on these reports. We encourage leaving a comment to warn others. 

Amazon and eBay generally have good buyer protection. If you choose to purchase from a third-party seller through their platforms and run into issues, it should be easy to get your money back promptly. You may have more difficulties with Newegg or Walmart.

"EngineeringPorn","t5_2smf3","You can check computational quantum physics/chemistry and computational material physics. These are large fields, goes without saying a lot of smart people spent their life optimizing the algorithms efficiency, and they are fields that use a lot of computing power on top of that. Traditionally it's been high performance computing clusters, think like thousands of CPUs in a highly optimized system dedicated to science, but as far as I get it cloud computing is gaining traction. Still doesn't lead to breakthrough in solar power or supraconductors with a finger snap, more like you model one very particular material or molecule and run lengthy computations to optimize one parameter or get some physical properties.

And just to be clear, the usage of quantum physics here is just to get the equations you try to solve, the computers are classical.",1651363289

Some of those are pretty niche. I can absolutely see a circumstance bonus to AC being more valued than them, for specific sorcerers in specific circumstances.

I'd say that they know by far the most about me, even more then my therapist. But as I said: this trust has been earned over several years, it wasn't like this from the start. At the beginning it was very hard to open up about my feelings.. let alone showing my weak spots.. 

More generally speaking: talking about or expressing emotions isn't something that comes natural to me. I often need quite some time to figure out how I'm feeling about Something.. I also usually seek to make up my mind about the feelings first before I'm ready to talk. But it's a skill that can be trained. Through therapy I learned to recognize my emotions faster and also how to speak about them... it really gets easier the more you practice. 

Talking about feelings still isn't my favourite thing to do, but it's not as hard as it used to be.",1651363289

There's a special set of skills required to look at an item that drops from vaal temple and decide if it's worth picking up. It took me a long time to figure out what was good, but awakened poe trade macro helped a good deal.

"antiwork","t5_2y77d","He will be charged with fraud for using PPP funds illegitimately.

In order to have your PPP loans be forgiven you need to provide the bank that disburse your PPP loans with payroll reporting to prove that the money went into payroll. The payroll reporting is backed by the bank statements as these statements show ACH transaction from the payroll employer organization. If the employees are paid in checks then copies of checks must be provided. Regardless, both methods would also require the borrower to provide IRS Form 941, these are quarterly statements that shows payroll income taxes made to the IRS based on the employees pay.

Granted only 60% of the funds need to be used for payroll.

For non-payroll expenses, such as leases, mortgages, supplier goods such as food, etc. The requirement is that invoices and bank statements/ checks need to tie together. Additionally the borrower has to prove that the business had these expenses on February 2020 or prior.",1651363290

Like Eiko seems like she's managing fine, but maybe someone alongside her would make her put less pressure on herself? Or it might help her focus on one part more? There could be so many reasons that im not really confident on any.

I do wonder though about the integrated part, like will this become like, a band/duo type of thing? The new ending seems to imply such. It does feels a little contradictory because it feels like they've been setting up Eiko to be a solo singer. I dont think I'll mind Kabe getting some solo focus, since I liked this episode, but I think I'd still rather have Eiko be the main focus rather than it being split between them. But then again, it doesn't seem like Kabe really has any super aspiring goals like Eiko does, and his main conflict is something that will presumably be fixed after next episode.",1651363291

If you do a bigger CP3 to handle bigger injectors, your lift pump will be your limiter. Check out FASS lift pumps, get at least 165gph if not more for your current setup. Install with a good sump.

It is not about you or your character. Know that.

"Halloweenmovies","t5_2y6fa","tbh, i think it was karen ""being warned of her death"" in a weird way. There's 2 other instances in Kills that also has death loom over Karen.

The scene where Laurie and Hawkins are talking about how Michael looks out his window, Karen looks through the glass of the door to Laurie's room. The scene around then darkens to her, alone. Then she shakily grabs Laurie's hand. Hawkins lines while that happened were:

""Maybe he wasn't looking out. Maybe he's looking in—at his reflection.""

The way that scene plays out, Karen definitely saw something. Something that terrified her and I think she saw herself dying.

And then that leads into her attempt to save Allyson from Michael. Now the line ""You want to fucking kill someone, take me"" isn't really special on its own, its just a cool one-liner that's said whenever a character wants to protect another character, but the next line is interesting.

""I'm an innocent woman; **just like ur sister was**. **It was Halloween night, and it was right here—in ur house.**""

She went through the effort of comparing herself to Michael's sister. Was it in an attempt to lead Michael away? Maybe, but why even go the extra mile? She already had his mask, and his attention; ppl who usually mention Michael's sister end up dead (Sartain, the podcasters), so the fact she does mention Judith was to flag to us, the audience, her death. And the last part of the line is even weirder:

""**Can't you feel it?**""

Feel what? The memories of Judith as her body froze over, unmoving. The feeling of death. She was asking Michael if you could feel death coming for him. Because, a few minutes later, the crowd jumps him and then she says what she said to Michael when he got tricked and ""killed"" in the last movie.

""Gotcha.""

But she didn't, none of them did. As Michael lived. No one else could see child Michael. Child Michael was merely an omen for Karen. From the glass in the hospital enveloping her in darkness to the point she had to cower into the comfort of her Mother's hand; to her going as far as comparing herself to Michael's very first victim to lead him away from her daughter—Karen was marked for death, and that was what child Michael in the window symbolized.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: At the beginning of the 3rd act, the movie begins to hint @ Karen's death—the child Michael in the window looming over her acting as the final clue. It started with the window in the hospital, showing her an empty void with only her in it; the lonely darkness that follows after death. The 2nd hint was her comparing herself to Judith and child Michael was the 3rd strike. Child Michael appearing, in general, is a creative decision and is 100% just up to our interpretation.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR x2: Child Michael represents death, and death was coming for Karen.",1651363294

Most of the time I do a lot of ""get to know you"" stuff in the beginning and it usually ends up boring and fizzles out, even if there is good conversation from it it doesn't lead to anything. I wanted to show her that I am genuinely interested and not playing around wanting to cut to the chase, I thought she might be impressed by that. So you are seeing it as thirsty (and maybe her too tbf) but the way I was meaning it was like ""I know what I want, you are beautiful, let's go on a date, who needs anymore icebreakers.""

I said the ""nah fr"" thing because I took ""lmaooo"" as her gushing a bit and maybe not taking the compliment seriously so I wanted to drive it home. Maybe I misread it, I was *hoping* she was not meaning like ""aha the little boy is attracted to me, how cute.""

The defnition you pulled from Wikipedia is right, in my opinion, when it stresses that it has to be a war tale told in a melodramatic way, filled with 'chivalric romance' and crazy high stakes adventures. There are elements of those in some episodes, but I don't think those describe that whole arc.

The same article you quoted mentions another important point, in my point of view: adding ""opera"" to a literary genre was an early 20th century protest against formulaic, repetitive stories with the same thrills and beats being transplanted to different settings.

So all these folks here in the comments saying ""Trek is quintessential Space Opera"" are not  taking in consideration if they said the same thing about it when it was on TV, it would be considered berating the show.

I understand people are coming to this discussion with a modern conceptualization of Space Opera in mind, but it's one I disagree with, as I've always seen the term and most stories associated with Space Opera as very, very bad.

It's my belief that this modern, positive take on the Space Opera genre, ironically, reproduces a model in which several different autors all tell very similar stories in their books, movies and TV shows, beat by beat. Which caused the term Space Opera to appear derogatively in the first place.

So when I say I don't think Trek works as Space Opera, I'm saying I don't think this franchise is meeting its best while trying to emulate the tropes of other sci-fi franchises. It should be doubling down on what makes it unique.",1651363297

"AskAnAmerican","t5_2uah7","There are some features added to homes to reduce the damage of small tornadoes OR specifically to keep the resident safe.

 I'm in Oklahoma and a lot of houses have storm cellars. Basically a hole in the ground, lined, with a door. Sometimes these are inside houses, like in a garage floor, or in the backyard. Most homes do not have basements here. I believe it is because of the clay soil and high water table? 

Most newer homes here are also fitted with metal connections called hurricane straps between the roof and house to keep it from coming off. I'm not a builder so I don't know specifics, but they are inexpensive and can be retrofitted to homes. 

There's nothing that will keep a home 100% safe from damage. Tornadoes are so powerful and can carry extremely heavy and dangerous debris. It's not always about the wind, it's what the wind carries with it. 

That said, apart from rare extremely large tornadoes, most are small and short lived on the ground. They are also very localized and may damage several houses in a neighborhood and leave the rest untouched. I don't think most people here worry about them too much. It is of course good to be prepared and have a plan during tornado season, but it is unlikely your specific home will be the one that gets taken out. More likely you will lose power for a day or need to take shelter if it is in your area.

People typically watch live storm tracking on the local news or online, and then if it seems a tornado will touch down in their area, they will take shelter. Either in a storm shelter or an interior room with no windows. Or they'll go outside and film it because [Okies is crazy! ](https://imgur.com/a/EuK46ge)",1651363299

"OnlineDating","t5_2qpe9","I'm not saying that waiting till marriage has to be a thing. And let's not forget that women that were getting married throughout history were often in their teens and early teens at that. Waiting until marriage when you're 26 is a lot different than at 15. 

The point, anyway, that I was trying to make is that it's probably not best to consider sex as such a huge factor of whether or not to commit to someone. People can improve at sex. It's not a binary, either you're good or you're not. Just because the sex in the beginning might not be mind-blowing, doesn't mean it won't ever be. Wouldn't it be more wise to consider the character of the person way more than their sexual ability? If the man is humble, self-aware, self-reflects, listens, willing to learn etc. then couldn't you foresee him becoming a better sexual partner to you over time?   


You know who can be really fantastic at sex? Toxic and unhealthy people. Narcissists, and I mean people with the actual personality disorder, are pretty well-known to give really amazing sex. It's one way they hook people. The initial sex with someone really doesn't give you much insight into their character or how they will treat you outside the bedroom. 

\&gt;I would absolutely hate to go to my grave knowing that I only slept with one person my entire life and never ever got to experience sexuality and sexual freedom.

I mean there are plenty of people who never had sex or vowed a life of chastity that have lived way more meaningful lives and touched more people (figuratively) than a lot of us who have a plethora of sexual experiences. I think it's fine to want sexual experience, but to make it a huge part of your life purpose and meaning may not be optimal.

\&gt;I have so much pity for people with your mentality because it is either religiously based or because you think a woman isn't worthy of you if she's slept around which still goes back to purity.

It would be moreso her values and thoughts regarding sex which I would consider. We all have a past and that's fine, but what are her views on sex now is more important. The literature is pretty clear though. Higher sexual partners in women is correlated with higher rates of substance abuse, infidelity, mental health issues and personality disorders.",1651363299

Key Takeaways  
\*A Ukrainian counteroffensive out of Kharkiv City will likely alleviate pressure on parts of the city that have suffered the most from Russian shelling and may force Russian troops from Izyum to re-deploy northward to support forces maintaining the partial encirclement of Kharkiv.

\*Additional Russian forces are deploying to the Izyum front but are unlikely to enable any major advances.

\*Russian troops did not make any confirmed advances to the southwest or southeast of Izyum or to the west of the Donetsk-Luhansk frontline.

\*Russian forces in Kherson are pausing major offensive operations to improve their tactical positions and regroup to prepare for a renewed offensive to capture the administrative borders of Kherson.

\*Russian occupation forces in Mariupol announced plans to consolidate their control over the city and intend to return Ukrainian citizens forcibly deported into Russia at some point in the future.",1651363299

"lupus","t5_2rtve","Excess sun can cause a systemic reaction in lupus which can flare up everything else like fatigue/joint pain, etc. 

From the lupus centers of America on why this happens:

Exposure to UV light causes damage to everyone’s cellular DNA, explains Sabrina Newman, MD, a board-certified dermatologist. “UV radiation is what causes cell damage, regardless of whether it’s coming from the sun or a lamp,” she says.

It’s what happens next that differs. “In people with lupus, the cells are much more sensitive to the damage caused by UV radiation,” Newman says. “Once the cells are damaged, the immune system clears them, but people with lupus have a much slower clearance of these cells.”

The dead cells stick around in the body, triggering an immune system attack. “We have antibodies in our immune systems that typically are used to fight infection. But in people with lupus, the antibodies wrongly target proteins within normal cells and cause an immune reaction,” explains Benjamin Chong, MD, associate professor in the Department of Dermatology at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas.

Pour moi, ils se baseront sur les notes obtenues en contrôle continu. Donc la surnotation ne passe pas du tout à côté du problème, elle est le problème numéro 1. 

On ne peut faire progresser des élèves sans des évaluations formatives, où ils risquent d'échouer et d'obtenir de mauvaises notes, mais cela leur permettra de progresser par la suite en acquérant la méthodologie. Si on est obligé de surnoter pour avoir une augmentation, beaucoup d'élèves ne feront plus d'efforts (et je comprends tout à fait, pourquoi s'ennuyer à améliorer la forme de sa dissertation ou à apprendre l'enchaînement idée/citation/connaissance si je reçois déjà un 18?), d'autres ne percevront pas leurs progrès... Ce serait extrêmement mauvais pour le niveau des élèves.

Qu'on ne me dise pas que c'est impossible puisque c'est déjà le cas avec le bac et Parcoursup qui empêchent de plus en plus de faire des évaluations formatives en 1ere terminale sans plomber les chances de son élève (alors que c'est justement le moment où ils doivent être formés à des méthodes compliquées).",1651363300

"starcitizen","t5_2v94d","CPUs can matter for graphics as well; a year ago SC's renderer thread, the long set of instructions to gather the data and drawing instructions to pack up and send to the GPU for the GPU to interpret into shaded triangles and then turn them into pixels to send to the monitor, was single-threaded and this runs on the CPU. 

Before Gen12 started being added to the game, SC was extremely CPU-bottlenecked for the renderer, meaning if your CPU was bad enough it'd be making the GPU sit idle and bored because it couldn't keep up with sending data to it. Have a beefy expensive card and GPU utilization might be 15% because it would be stuck waiting for the CPU to pop one out of its ancient pipes.

Gen12 is turning the render thread multithreaded, which means it'll be able to use as many CPU cores as you can provide it (at first they're limiting it to 4, I'm to understand) and the CPU renderer bottleneck is broken and the CPU is less directly important for SC's fps.

But CPUs are where you run physics, updating game logic, local AI processing (oh GOD Arma 3 AI is so heavy), and all that, so yeah, in general when a system/engine is built properly the GPU is most important for graphics and CPU matters for physics/AI/etc.",1651363301

My technique follows existing grout lines or seams. We back cut 8""-12"" at ""T"" intersections to full depth guaranteeing minimal shortcut cracks. Concrete is then washed and first coat of sealer applied. Saw cuts are then filled with a color matched grout or caulking and after it dries we applied the final coat of sealer, usually with a traction additive. Takes some experience and practice to achieve the desired results. You have to know what you're looking for just to find them, most people can't see them even after they're pointed out.",1651363302

I started PT 2 weeks post-op and said something about the back pain to the PT.  There's an on-site chiropractor so between her gently massaging/ pushing on things each PT session, special tape the first few weeks of PT on my back, using the TENS machine the first PT session on my back instead of my hip, ice every morning after I get out of bed, and sleeping with a back pain pillow under my knees for a while (stopped with that because it was starting to bother my knee), I can honestly say that in general my back pain is actually reduced from pre-surgery.

"noveltranslations","t5_39owk","Just had some free time to read this week and coincidentally saw this post so decided to post them lol.

I've read CCG like a year ago? Not sure, but it had only like 900 chapters and I put it on hold since I wanted to binge read it once it's finished.

I stopped around chapter 500 and in my opinion, it was pretty good. It's a good light hearted comedy with a nice cultivation system. If you like comedy, you should take a look, if it doesn't hit after like 30 chapters you should probably stop though. Tone doesn't change much, it's a comedy from start to finish with a few serious moments like when Song (Mc) takes his first kill.

There were some small annoying parts, like the onion monster lady who literally tried to kill Song and his innocent mortal parents several times and got away with it. Not only did she get away with it, Song even helped her a lot and eventually she became a powerhouse thanks to him. Sometimes author just does some annoying things like that for comedy and hope you either forget it or don't mind it lol.

Cultivation isn't the main focus but the cultivation system it has is at least better than the classic 'gather energy until you get to the ninth minor realm of the major realm and repeat it until you become a god emperor' lol, so that's a small bonus if you care about that stuff.

 I remember enjoying the novel a lot though.",1651363303

"offmychest","t5_2ranw","You ever notice in the papers when teachers get caught for inappropriate conduct with a student there's almost always a LONG line of other students that suddenly come out of the woodwork and say ""Hey, Mr \_\_\_ did that to me too!"", the whole reason for this is because we're conditioned, through various means, to not talk about things that might be shameful, all those other victims come out and say their piece because one person was brave or strong enough to stand up and say ""No, this isn't right"".   
Just recently it happened with one of my former teachers, he's facing a whole lot of hell because so far about nine girls have come forward and independently described nearly identical sets of events as that first girl who spoke up, who knows how many more there are who don't have the strength or just can't go through with reliving what he put them through... He taught at that school for more than twenty years, and the years between the girls who have come forwards spans the better portion of that time.   
These things don't just suddenly happen, and the rare ones you hear about who only did the bad thing once... I'd bet my last dollar that there's more than a few additional victims in their wake who just can't bring themselves to speak up.   
That said, you did absolutely nothing wrong, there is literally nothing an 18 year old can do to ""lead on"" a grown ass man who knows better.

Swap in wound isnt useless but since I'm likely to take a big hit that will leave me a single shot away from death I'm not quite sure its useful. Maybe I'm reading it incorrectly so its possible it will deal 60% of the targets max hp in which case its good but I would still prefer a damage that is instant over letting me take a hit. No escape sounds good but most dinos I feel threatened by ignore it anyway. Then there is minimal critical counter, worthless no damage done and all it does is raise crit which is already crap compared to the dino you used to make it.

Merciless alert is good dont get me wrong but honestly do you really need more then 5200 damage done by level 26, probably not. Good for packs and I guess if you just wanted to deal as much damage to an evasion dino then it beats out albertosaurus.

All in all I do wonder if the coins and dna is even worth investing into if you compare them. The only thing that it beats albertosaurus on is speed and as I said you very likely dont need more damage then the two moves from albertosaurus anyway.

"Deltarune","t5_qmi8w","Lmao this, but I do recommend watching videos on the tea theory if you haven’t. I suppose you’d like getting further evidence of Kris’s dislike of Ralsei. Here’s a little sample of that theory- the HP given to the drinker of the Kris/Ralsei/Susie/Noelle tea depends entirely on their liking to them- like how Noelle gets 400HP for Susie tea, and Susie gets 120HP for Kris tea. No one seems to like themselves much though... only 10 HP for their own aha. Kris gets only... 50 HP for Ralsei’s tea? Compared to the “median” of 70HP (shown through Noelle drinking Ralsei tea- they’re practically strangers, so it makes sense for ~70HP to be an indicator of a neutral opinion). If I remember the numbers correctly, anyway. Some people believe Kris’s negative opinions of Ralsei come from the moments where Ralsei prompts Kris to look in Susie’s perspective- likely telling Kris things that, we, the players, cannot hear. This is further supported by when, in the snowgrave route, Kris refuses to look into Susie’s perspective during the Ferris wheel scene when Ralsei prompts it. It’s quite apparent that Kris must not like Ralsei much. If this interested you, I totally recommend looking further into the tea theory! If not, then... well, sorry for wasting your time, aha. 😅",1651363305

I just downvoted your comment.
 
# FAQ
 
## What does this mean?
 
The amount of karma (points) on your comment and Reddit account has decreased by one.
 
## Why did you do this?
 
There are several reasons I may deem a comment to be unworthy of positive or neutral karma. These include, but are not limited to:
 
* Rudeness towards other Redditors,
* Spreading incorrect information,
* Sarcasm not correctly flagged with a `/s`.
 
## Am I banned from the Reddit?
 
No - not yet. But you should refrain from making comments like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.
 
## I don't believe my comment deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?
 
Sure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.
 
## How can I prevent this from happening in the future?
 
Accept the downvote and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on Reddit.com. I will continue to issue downvotes until you improve your conduct. Remember: Reddit is privilege, not a right.",1651363305

Nothing there is there because people like it or are particularly passionate about it. It’s simply to show off how much money they have. Do people buy an expensive car because it’s from a historic brand that makes quality cars with sophisticated styling and great performance? No, they buy it because it shows off how rich they are. That’s a part of our culture I hate. The flashiness, the everything over the top, bright, everything in your face, but nothing underneath. Miami, LA, Vegas, and some other cities perfectly emulate that culture.",1651363306

Like if they start to never peek a one way, don’t use it, or play from a different spot. If they always seem to break your trips, move them. Having them in a slightly less useful spot is better than them doing nothing. The biggest thing that I always found myself Doing is relying on the setups. That won’t work usually.

The idiots that post fake videos are not helping the cause at all and one has to wonder what is their motive here? To prove how gullible people can get?

Domination isn't about sex.  Domination is not about impact play.  Domination isn't about rope.

It is about being in control. You can do that without ever touching someone.  I have been in power exchange dynamics from across the country,  never have ANY naked time,  and it still be a fulfilling dynamic.

If you think Domination is just about sex,  then take some time and learn what Domination is.  The Loving Dominant and Mastering BDSM are two good places to start.  Go to conferences and take classes.  Very few of the classes are about sex. There will be some technique classes,  some 101 classes,  some relationship classes,  some communication classes,  and there will be classes on sex, but there is SO much more than sex.

"litrpg","t5_3667v","&gt;All the influential charactersin the story (including a god) keep mentioning how complicated and intresting and amazing he is and i m having a hard time understanding why.

If jason was a character in real life, his friends would have long ago sat down and talked with him and got him to tone down his asinine levels of eccentricity. And all of his gambits to be goofy and confuse his targets, well they wouldn't have the desired result at all, people wouldn't see him as a social genius sowing confusion, he'd just very transparently look foolish and people would very sincerely ask him to stop...

I've read through most of the He who Fights with Monsters books that are published on Kindle so far and enjoy the story overall, but I think Jason's character is just a little bit overpowered on the charisma score. He does very silly stuff, that surely wouldn't work with real people, but his silly stuff succeeds perfectly with all the clown NPC characters in his orbit and it works to his credit unbelievably much. I think as a reader you just gotta accept that this is part of the power fantasy. When Jason does a silly thing, he sells it and the other characters buy it. When an IRL person does it, not so much - but that's the power fantasy in the story, that's just how the character works.   

It's a good series and a lot of joy can be found in it, if you can find it in you to tone down your reaction to jason's antics. I don't think he really gets much better as the story goes on, but if you let yourself go along with it, then it's fine.",1651363308

&gt;In all comparative analyses, humans always fall on the borderline between obligate monogamy and polygamy. Here, we use behavioural indices (sociosexuality) and anatomical indices (prenatal testosterone exposure indexed by 2D : 4D digit ratio) from three human populations to show that this may be because there are two distinct phenotypes in both sexes. While males are more promiscuous and display higher prenatal testosterone exposure than females overall, our analyses also suggest that the within-sex variation of these variables is best described by two underlying mixture models, suggesting the presence of two phenotypes with a monogamous/promiscuous ratio that slightly favours monogamy in females and promiscuity in males. The presence of two phenotypes implies that mating strategy might be under complex frequency-dependent selection.",1651363308

Balls deep in one project, phone rings, well now this other client site's server is down, get that going again and then back to the project, few minutes later start getting hit up in teams chat about some other sites offsite backup not working and owner is freaking out, drop everything to get that resolved, which also means now I have to work after hours that night since obviously can't saturate their internet during business hours doing a new offsite seed, back to the project, trying to remember where I was...bossman calls, wants to know how the project is coming because we have a deadline, well sir project isn't on track because I got interrupted by A, B, and C, well we have to get that done or else it's a *big fucking deal* so now working on that after hours along with the offsite backup problem.  Get the kid to bed and spend another 3-4 hours working on that shit before passing out myself, wake up to my phone ringing 30 minutes before my alarm goes off, well some other site is apparently hard down and they can't do anything remotely, so guess who gets to drive 45 minutes to the jobsite to get that shit working again?  Take care of that, finally make it into the office, bossman is literally standing there at my office door wanting an update on the project I spent half the night working on, bring him up to speed, get back into that shit again, work on it for about an hour and then some VIPs email got compromised because they outright *refuse* to use MFA and consequently all their external contacts got bullshit phishing emails from them and that's a ***huge*** *fucking deal*, spend a good 40 minutes arguing with him and getting his email locked back down and cleaned up, back to project...hours and hours behind where I should be so another night of work at home, *after* my 10 hour day in the office...

I know every job has things that make it suck major ass at times, but I don't know, the thought of being responsible for merely getting a trailer from here to there by a certain time, safely and efficiently, just sounds so fucking appealing compared to my typical day as described above.  I know there's a lot I'm sure I'm completely ignorant of that goes into it, but man, just being able to put my brain into low gear and *drive* sounds heavenly.",1651363308

A store bought blanket wouldn't last 40 years. It barely lasts 5 not going to lie.

Prime example: I was given a lot of baby blankets for my child when he was born. All but two were store bought and after a year or two were either thrown away or re-purposed (as scrap fabric or stuffing) because they just had too much damage. The two that weren't store bought? One was a hand-sewn Winnie the Pooh themed blanket. It is still going strong and is currently with my cousin for his baby. The other? A gorgeous hand knitted blanket that is currently still on my 9 year old son's bed. I have had to repair it once but otherwise it still looks practically new (minus one stain).

My mom has afghans crocheted by my great grandmother and quilts sewn by my great aunt that are still looking great. Minus one that a puppy got ahold off, I actually have it in my repair pile after finding it in a closet a few months ago (my mom didn't have the heart to just throw it away).

If you don't know what a ""Sharpe Ratio"" is you have no business doing trading. I'll put 1 million PHP on the line for zfreek or any pinoy trader or internet trader/scammer. 1000 days of day trading bet that they can beat the market.  Publish the day before entry/exit price. 1000 trading days straight. 1K PHP / day they are wrong or right. Need some guarantee they can pay thru escrow.

You know why I'm so confident? Even my FB feed is riddled with ZFREEK shills ""Oh I made this trade on this stock and I got 50% gain already. You should join Zfreek Trading Group. Thank you so much for making me money. "" 

Then I quiz them to understand what's going on oh yeah its because you have to make that post in order to get 2 free training sessions from ""THE LEGEND HIMSELF"". LOL.

Guess how they make money? Trading or teaching the illusion of a successful trader. They need constant fresh meat of schmucks from social media like you. Sorry to be blunt. ""A fool and his money are soon parted."" After 2-3 months these FB friends go cold quiet because they lost their money.

"GirlGamers","t5_2rfec","Windows systems give a lot more bang for the buck, but if you have an Intel based Macintosh you can install windows on it with boot camp, and depending on your GPU or the games you want to try first, it will work okay. 

(although windows 11‘s system requirements are really annoyingly picky, and it wouldn’t surprise me if not of them can run it, and windows 10 will stop getting updates I think in 2025 maybe?  I’m hoping this is a temporary thing in the expand windows 11 to everything windows 10 runs on, but who knows…)

You can’t install Windows on the newer M1 Macintoshes though, unfortunately. Maybe through emulation, but not directly, so I doubt it would work very well for most games.

Personally I’d recommend gog.com as the best main source to buy games from (mostly windows though some games there run on macOS and Linux too). It’s drm free so you actually own the games you’re buying, unlike steam and other download services. 

Steam and other services you’ll want to avoid stuff with secondary drm like denuvo or whatever they come up with next. I used pc gaming wiki to try to check if a game has extra drm. 

You’ll want to use epic’s game store if for no other reason than they’ve been giving away one or two free games per week for several years now. Sometimes indie things, something’s even big things. I’ve got a huge collection from them. 

And you don’t have to build yourself, if you don’t want to. I’ve almost always been happy with Dell/Alienware being well built and non-gimmicky pretty much, and supporting their hardware with bios updates longer than anyone. 

AMD’s CPUs are excellent too. 

Oh, and if you haven’t tried it, I’ve actually liked Apple Arcade, which is $5 a month full price, and I think everything runs on Macintoshes too? (I mostly did the three month demo on my AppleTV)

It’s cheaper even if you prepay for a year. 

I liked Fantasian by the Final Fantasy creator, which might be his last game. South of the Circle I think it’s called was a neat story, quite good. What the Golf was laugh out loud funny.  Frogger was actually surprisingly funny. I was going to play Necrobarrista but didn’t make it in time.",1651363312

بس جه وقت و قعدت مع نفسي، و أوازن بين المذاكرة و أنا مبسوط اد ايه و أنشطتي كشاب ايه غير المذاكرة، كنت بلعب رياضة أيوة و بخرج آخر الترم، بس بردو كنت حاسس إني ظالم نفسي و متعتي

قولت هقلل مذاكرة شوية، مش هتفرق أوي في درجاتي، بس هتفرق جامد في أنشطتي غير المذاكرة

و حصل بالفعل، و وصلت لدرجة إني مبقتش أذاكر غير عند الاحتياج (امتحان أو مناقشة أو كده) في مقابل راحتي النفسية و عدم تنشنة و وقت فاضي كتير

شوف طبيعية دراستك و وازن بين مذاكرتك و أنشطتك و هواياتك اللي حابب تعملها، و متمحورش حياتك حولين مذاكرة و درجات مش هتفتكر منها حاجة غير إنها ضيعت وقت راحتك و متعتك الحقيقية",1651363312

"DetroitPistons","t5_2sgpl","It’s only as valuable as who we could sign or trade for with it. we already have the most cap space in the league this offseason and its not a very strong FA class. Im not super FA savvy but I trust Weaver (as of right now) to get the right value out of our pieces, but personally I only wannt ship out Grant if we draft Chet, Jabari or Paolo (which would obviously make sense in top 3).  

fun hypothetical but who knows where we land! could get 1 again for all we know and the question would become if we should trade down instead.",1651363312

Even with incremental differences between levels, a +6 weapon and a player level of 86 is going to see a *massive* difference in defense and offense from someone who is at +3 and level 25, which is about where you’d usually be when you’re at Godrick.  You can’t fake news straight numbers, dude.

It’s absolutely about stats, knowledge, and strategy.  Higher stats give you more leeway to gain knowledge before dying and largely make strategy unimportant.  If you go back to Limgrave with a +6 BHF at level 86 you’re 2, maybe 3 shotting even the stronger enemies.",1651363312

"climbharder","t5_2s5er","Synovitis.. finger curls/rolls daily 6x20 1min rest.

Helped mine, maybe with a decrease in hard climbing intensity, but I seem to have cured mine 2y ago, and I think I've pinpointed it to this exercise, now helps my joints to stay healthy and recover from hard sessions.

High volume and frequency, low to medium load. For healing in general, bloodflow is king. That means lower load high reps rehab work. For joints this means plenty of lighter movement, full range of motion. The synovial fluids get moving and deliver nutrients for repair. Plus voodoo flossing of joints, purges the fluids. On contrary, full immobilising rest is not the best idea for many types of injuries, light controlled exercising while not overloading is better.


From my search for me best technique: barbell finger curls, altho can perform w dumbbells, a barbell works well in practice, is stable so can focus on rolling, and can be micro loaded to desired weight better:
https://youtu.be/TiXGR4p1dwY


Detailed protocol mixed from reddit users, I do:

 - 6 sets x 20 reps (even 30 could)

 - 1 min rest between sets (if dumbbell used, alternate hands + 30s rest)

 - 20-40kg for my medium climber level, choose weight so the volume is manageable for you even for last sets, yet you receive a decent pump. And it has to work for you with your chosen frequency (every other day could do heavier vs daily). Still staying more in the moderate (vs light weight) is imo important for the joints to get loaded and moving well. If you can't finish 20reps of any set, lower the weight next time.

 - frequency daily to even twice a day (some say even 3x a day but that's quite brutal and would require lowering weights even more for that to stay in pure rehab mode and manage recovery). When issues recede I now do it only sporadically as a rehab finger joints prevention exercise a few times a week, or can even view it as a forearm hypertrophy/endurance pump exercise and implement progressive overload with more demanding weights and more rest days.


Hope this helps, DM me w questions, eg if voodoo flossing isn't clear on the internet. Sorry OP for hijacking your thread, wanted to help this fella.",1651363313

"ATHX","t5_39c5o","&gt;Thanks. And I agree that your analysis is quite sound.  As many folks may know, I like to ask ""what if"".  So I notice that the limiting parameter in MASTERS1 was the mRS &lt;=1 percentage.   Consider these statistics for patients treated within 36 hours from Masters1  
&gt;  
&gt;mRS &lt;=1was 1\`6.1%;  BI&gt;95 was 58%;  and NIHSS &lt;=1 was 32%.  Since all three of these are needed to achieve an EO, the EO percentage was 16.1%.   Assuming that TREASURE does as well as MASTERS1 wrt BI and NIHSS, then for every point of mRS improvement we would expect to see a point of EO improvement.   I believe that most previous stroke trials have measured mRS improvement and they have shown the importance of early treatment to improve mRS.  Also  TREASURE has quite a few inclusion and exclusion criteria which I believe will increase the mRS percentage.   Although I expect the BI and NIHSS score to increase over that to MASTERS, if only the mRS goes up an additional 5% to 10% then we are looking at potentially 21% to 26% EO.   Thoughts?",1651363314

 For most guys, it would be a matter of ""coming to terms"" with becoming ok with whatever you've got. For you....it's a matter of (somehow) seeing your dick HOW ANYONE ELSE sees it. That's your problem. Not seeing reality accurately.

&amp;#x200B;

I mean this with all kindness and sincerity. You should consider some sort of counselling/psychiatric help with this. You can ""fix"" this.  Your problem is something to do with your mind. It might be related to body dysmorphia (not a subject I know much about). But the point is....you SHOULD be happy with your dick (because it's nice). Since you aren't....you should look into WHY? (and it's not because you're actually small--by anyone's standards).

This is a rather arbitrary rule, if you didn't teach a rule here (ie you didn't say ""Oxford commas are necessary"" or ""Oxford commas are forbidden"") then you would have less rules to remember.

And ""standard"" isn't necessary, and isn't something we pursue in British English. Language is descriptive, not prescriptive, and we largely recognise that. We don't fund our own equivalent of the (rather silly) French Immortals policing language, because it's unnecessary.

I'll be honest, I only even heard the term ""Oxford comma"" after finishing school, and never had the rule taught to me. While I was shit at English, this part never caused me an issue, both it's absence and presence.",1651363317

"OnePunchMan","t5_2vm97","Like another commenter said, the main issue I have with the manga is that it’s half a remake of the webcomic and half an original story, failing to realize it’s potential in either category. 

The webcomic for the longest time, in comparison to the manga, was just inferior. The manga mostly just followed the same progression with massively upgraded art, additional fights and mini-arcs, and overall better world building. It wasn’t afraid to make changes, but they were all conducive to the plot and improved on weaker or insignificant elements of the webcomic. Examples of this are Flash vs. Hellfire and Gale, and Child Emperor vs Phoenix Man, which might as well not have even happened in the webcomic. Even stuff like Tatsumaki vs Psykos/Orochi, a fight I’m not the biggest fan of beyond visuals, didn’t massively impede on the narrative. 

But the current garou fight is a bit different. Unlike in the previous 3 examples, which are basically the manga freestyling and not relying on the webcomic at all, Garou vs Saitama leans heavily on borrowed scenes and moments from the webcomic, while also massively changing the events. This ends up making the borrowed moments feel underwhelming and empty without the proper context, and prevents the new content from shining and telling its own unique version of the events.

An example of this is the speech Garou makes to Tareo about how there will be no one left to harm him or save him. In the webcomic, this was stated after Garou tore Black Sperm in half and sent Golden Sperm flying, and before Garou proceeds to demolish the S-Class heroes. In the manga, he says this before engaging Saitama, when Tareo has no one actively trying to harm him, and Garou isn’t paying attention to the squad of heroes trying to get him out of there. So the quote in the manga is lacking the sufficient context (Tareo being held hostage while heroes try to rescue him) and the lasting impact (Garou demolishing the people trying to kill and save him). There’s a few more examples but I think that one illustrates it the best.",1651363317

In the most basic scenario the artillery computer would coordinate with propulsion computer and the station keeping thrusters would fire simultaneously with the gun to compensate.

In one book I've read where the space combat was depicted more ""realistically"" (if you can use that word) the whole ship was deliberately flown in an extremely complex trajectory to make it very difficult to track it and predict its movement as to make it harder to hit. Targeting computers were taking the data from the propulsion to compensate and keep the enemy ship in cross hairs and the guns' recoil was used to further randomize defending ship's movement.",1651363317

2 + 3 - your best bet for early progression on your first playthrough is to spend your first million or so on a handful of S class miners or traders and use those. They'll snowball your money up to buying M class, and then L, and finally stations. Manufacturing is where the real money starts flowing fast.

The person you're working with could also have an addiction, mental illness, language barriers, trauma, etc. which makes it sometimes more challenging to provide the best care for the client.

I work for a domestic violence shelter and do some of the court advocate work when my co-worker is out. We do much more than take people to court, we help with protection orders, make referrals to legal services, answer questions about court, take our client to a safe place if their abuser is trying to intimidate them in the court room. We deal with clients who can be drunk, high, experiencing a panic attack, or may not be able to read so we read all paperwork to them and help them fill everything out 

For some people, going to court can be one of the most frightening things they'll experience because there is lots of legal jargon that's hard to understand and they have to get up and talk in front of a lot of people. It's scary. 

Sometimes our advocacy is bringing food to our client who hasn't eaten all day because they've been too stressed to eat and they feel faint. Sometimes it's talking to them every day leading up to court, preparing them for what can happen. If court doesn't go in their favor, we're still there to support them and cry with them sometimes. 

We love what we do but it's difficult work some days. 

Also, our agency doesn't drive court clients, we always meet them at the courthouse.

For education, a lot of the court advocates here have an AA in a human services field.",1651363318

"news","t5_2qh3l","https://en.as.com/latest_news/who-is-for-and-against-the-regulation-of-ghost-guns-republicans-democrats-nra-n/


The Los Angels Police Department (LAPD) has reported that a single ghost gun was “linked to 24 murders, eight attempted murders, 20 robberies and 60 assaults with a deadly weapon by the end of last November.” In 2021 alone, the LAPD “recovered 1,921 ghost guns [...], more than double the 813 ghost guns recovered in 2020.”

“When making the sale, the seller will have to “include serial numbers on the kits’ frame or receiver.” This will mean that, like other firearms, those who sell them must “run background checks prior to a sale – just like they have to do with other commercially-made firearms.”

Under federal law, background checks are only required for licensed gun sellers. Unlicensed sellers, many of whom have been selling ghost guns, do not need to conduct background checks. This gap creates a loophole and to try and close it, the new rules require pawnbrokers and other federally licensed dealers that purchased one of these weapons to “put a serial number on the weapon before selling it to a customer.”

“First, while the founding fathers did not include any limits on the assembling of weapons, the Second Amendment does not stipulate the right to build an untraceable lethal weapon in your home. The 2012 Republican Party Platform reads that the GOP will “defend the law-abiding citizen’s God-given right of self-defense.” This is a common refrain within Republican discourse on gun control and its aims to protect the rights of “law-abiding citizens.”

Second, Massie has yet to author or propose a bill to make ghost guns harder to access. If Massie and other members of the GOP are in favor or limiting the circulation of ghost guns, they should propose a bill that would make some of the same changes offered by President Biden. If they disagree with the proposal, they can write a bill that invalidates or challenges the President’s order.

For a party that promotes itself as tough on crime and as strong supporters of police officers, the stance taken by the GOP seems to contradict these beliefs. For many law enforcement officials, the prevalence of these weapons makes their jobs more dangerous as they do not know if a person will have an unlicensed gun on them. “Approximately 20,000 suspected ghost guns reported to ATF (Alcohol, Firearms, and Tabacco) as having been recovered by law enforcement in criminal investigations – a ten-fold increase from 2016,” reported the White House on Monday.”

“Sadly many of these cases involve minors as these guns can be purchased online where age restrictions are not enforced.

On 25 February, a fourteen-year-old in Albuquerque killed a sixteen-year-old and just last week, a teenager killed a sixteen-year-old and injured two other students using this type of weapon.”

It’s simple: If you can’t pass a background check, you shouldn’t be able to build a gun in your basement.",1651363318

If they cannot get extra hours at work, look for a part time job, there are plenty at the moment. Also now is the time to create a budget, and stick to it. Also this person should investigate to figure out why they ended up $6000 in debt. Was it poor decision such as spending more than they make? Or was it something like a job loss or illness that decreased their income? If it was poor decision, a budget will help determine where that money is going in the future. If it was a job loss or something, this can be an opportunity for them to better prepare should this happen again by creating an emergency fund. 

$6000 is a lot of money, but not anything I would ever consider bankruptcy over. Really focus on paying it down and it should be gone within a year, maybe a couple months.

I agree on Dall/px -300 way too much for that series and I think Gst-250 way too high also, but you’re right Memphis has been struggling with shooting, they only do it when they have to. If Morant could hit 3’s at 40% instead of 30 or whatever they might be unbeatable.

People's concerns about Lamar were totally justified also.

Baltimore's done a good job of maximizing his strengths, but he's only developed marginally as a passer. 

But the larger point is that this year's QBs are just not good prospects. How in the world are you going to justify taking Malik Willis at #2 if Justin Fields went #14 last year?

Not to mention that practicing the draw will often flag people on your right the with the muzzle. Most ranges ban this style of holster draw because of this. Reholstering is also hazardous since you can't see the holster and if you run a gun without a manual safety, you could snag the trigger on a belt loop.

One of my friends used to back carry, also carries a phone and wallet in his back pocket. Got pickpocketed a few times, broke his phone screen, shot his TV. I mean, the TV thing was unrelated to the holster, but it was part of his mindset before he practiced safer gun handling and switched to strong side, like the rest of us.",1651363319

"cats","t5_2qhta","Most of these will be similar to dogs but I haven't owned a dog since I was a child so I could be wrong. 

1. You never know what you will get. By this I mean, I adopted both my cats from the shelter as kittens. One cat ended up with food allergies which means I have to buy expensive vet prescribed wet food to keep him from vomiting and having diarrhea all over the house. He will eat some dry food as a snack but prefers wet food. My other cat absolutely will not eat any dry food ever. This means she gets the food the other cat gets since they eat out of each other's bowls so double the price of the expensive wet food. Even with an appearance of a clean bill of health, that doesn't mean health issues won't pop up later. I have cat insurance which helps but vet bills can get expensive, especially diagnostics. 
2. Having to board them to go out of town. Since both are eating wet food, I can't ever be gone for more than 6-8 hours at a time since wet food can't be left out and can't be dispensed from a feeder. I work from home so that is not an issue on a day-to-day basis but it means I can't just put food in a feeder and leave their water fountain on and go on a trip overnight or a day or two. So, I have to figure boarding costs into any trip I take (and it isn't cheap). I do not have anyone that can come feed my cats and do not want strangers in the house, so I have to board them. 
3. Can't have nice furniture. When they were kittens, I had to spray paper towels with ""keep off"" to train them to stay off of things. Mainly this was things like the stove and the electrical cords. Now that they are about a year old, they are better about staying off dangerous things. However, they are still on the furniture, on the bed, on the shelves, etc. They do not USUALLY scratch the furniture but sometimes they do. And they shed everywhere. I do not have rugs or curtains since the house is hard enough to keep clean without those items since there is so much hair. Same with ""things"" on shelves. The only thing they have NOT knocked over or off is the TV. 
4. Can't leave human food out. They will lick anything left out. By left out, I mean I'm cooking and I walk two steps to the fridge to get another ingredient and turn back around and they are tasting whatever I left 5 seconds ago. This is fine for THEM for most things but some things are dangerous for them to eat. It is NOT okay with me since I don't like cat spit on my food. I put them in a room with a door, shut the door, cook my food, then let them back out when I'm done eating. 
5. The litter gets everywhere. Even then ""won't stick to your cats feet"" litter. EVERYWHERE 
6. When they are bored, you should just hide because the things they will do to cure their boredom are truly demonic. LOL Or just play with them, sometimes for hours. 
7. They do not recognize personal space or boundaries. Be prepared to shower, poop, have sex, watch tv, etc with an audience that is sometimes up close and personal. Even shutting them out of the room doesn't mean you will be alone, you will see little cat feet under the door and hear them meowing since you dared to shut the door. And when they want to sit in your lap, they WILL sit in your lap, no matter what you are doing at the time. It's their house and you are being allowed to live in it. 
8. They don't let you sleep. I don't usually have this issue since the spoiled brats have their own room where I make them sleep, door closed. However, the few times I've let them roam free at night, 30 minutes was the longest I slept without being woken by a cat on the bed trying to eat my feet, cats fighting on the bed, cats making noises in the other room that don't sound right, cats SITTING ON MY FACE, etc.   

All that said, I love the little buggers and I just have to live with the negative things to get the benefits. I'd say the only way to truly resolve most of these issues would be to not have cats or maybe just have a robot cat.",1651363320

im sorry for any mistakes english isnt my first language.

My uncle(44) sent a text to my mom(45) saying he was moving in tomorrow and he would explain when he moved. Heres where my problem is, i(18) dont live with my mom because she lives in a very very small apartment that has 1 bedroom, a very small kitchen and and a tiny living room. My uncle came from cuba 8 months ago (i was living with my mom at the time trying to move out) and got a job within weeks of coming to the US that payed him 150 a day for 5 days a week. My uncle has a lot of money and is known to be very greedy. When he started working my mom asked if he could pay half the rent since the landlord raised rent because he was living there, he got mad that he had to pay rent and his phone so his response was to get a place for himself to not pay half. After he moved out he has made my moms life a living hell to the point where she was very depressed and even got a bit ill because of it. He moved in with his best friend and now says he WILL move in with my mom again and is not explaining why. He is a complete narcissist that thinks brands and spending money make him better then anyone and thinks that he knows everything. He made my mom have to pay 300 dollars to the phone company because he decided he wanted to make an international call yet he lies and says it wasn’t him (we know it was because we went and checked with the phone company) he also never wanted to pay rent and eats all the food in the house without even buying more. My mom is too nice and i know he is taking advantage of the fact that she wont say no to him when he said he will move in without even asking her or talking to her about it before hand. I find this very disrespectful and feel like he is taking advantage of my mom and i want to tell him off for making her feel like dookie but i feel like that would upset my mom because she doesn’t want to leave him in the streets. he has a lot of money and i know he can go to a hotel until he gets his shit together but he wont. i just dont want my mom to be upset because of what i do since im know to have a very loose mouth when it comes to telling anyone off or when i see something wrong.

"gorillaz","t5_2rnhi","Ok.

So on the Gorillaz song “Andromeda” from their 2017 album *Humanz*, the singer Damon Albarn begins crying towards the end. This is because, according to OP, he is mourning the death of Bobby Womack, a previous collaborator and I presume a close friend to Albarn.

In the movie *The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers*, there is a scene where the character Aragorn kicks a helmet in a field. The actor who plays Aragorn, Viggo Mortensen, broke his toes by doing this, so the pain he feels in the scene is actually real. The cry of anguish he exhibits is actually (or at least partially) a cry of pain.

This factoid is brought up very often to the point of it being a meme. Looking up the scene on YouTube will find the comments full of jokes and parodies of this fact.

OP is trying to say that he uses the Andromeda fact so much that it is becoming funny/cliche, akin to the Viggo Mortensen fact.",1651363320

With my uncle he lived in Oklahoma, his name was Mikey Hoffman and I think he worked in computers or IT. I spent my teenage years trying to grow up in the fallout of while also trying to understand my own mental illness that was just starting to show. He lived far away (I'm in Ohio) so I never got to really get to know him. Most of my memories are stories I've heard. He left behind a wife but my family was extremely hostile to her. His ex wife left him after coming out as a lesbian and they were hostile towards her too. I'd love to talk to them just to see how my uncle was but I have no idea how to find them.

I worked with Ciara in my early 20s. She knew all the weird movies I watched as a kid and she liked them too. A few times I sat outside with her after she fought with her boyfriend. I got promoted and she got fired a few months afterwards. We drifted apart and I ended up getting a new phone and changing my number. I was going through a rough time with self-harm, depression and a bad realtionship. On November 5 I logged on Facebook and saw RIP post. I still wonder if maybe she tried to call or text only to find my old number out of service. I still message her on Facebook, I've looked at every part of her page because it's all I have now.

 leeching is essentially someone else doing the farming for you while your in their party. You can also farm or just choose to afk it if the mobs kill your fast enough. 

I highly recommend you find a leech until you can start grinding yourself. Or be like me, still leeching just for better income 😂 I am a mage class that can’t farm for jack shit, so I leech off my Guild leader’s GS. I rack in a total of 9M a day with leech, and 2.5M by myself (SADGE LOL)

# Posts with low effort truth statements are not allowed.

Your submission is considered ""low effort."" This doesn't inherently mean that it was *irrelevant* to r/technicallythetruth, but instead it was removed because it fit one or more of these criteria:

* Short, minimal-effort text posts like ""a water bottle without water is an air bottle"". Most, if not all text posts can and will be removed.

* Asking for upvotes, or saying things like ""sort by new"", ""let's get to the front page"", or anything related to cake days or karma.

* [Meta memes](https://imgur.com/qgkCskm), or any other post that tries to be clever by mentioning r/technicallythetruth.

* [Images that are hard to look at](https://imgur.com/yuMwr8a) because they are poorly made, deep-fried, or poorly cropped.

**Your submission could have also been removed because it is overdone:**

* Statements that say something like ""at least twelve"": [example 1](https://imgur.com/K1ZwEAv) | [example 2](https://imgur.com/dIkwEpU)

* Common statements that begin with ""on average..."": *the average amount of hands a person has is less than two* | *each person has, on average, one testicle and one boob*

* Low effort misunderstandings of everyday phrases: *How high are you  --&gt; ""I'm 5 foot 9""* 

* Common insults that are meant literally as opposed to being insulting: *""homosexuals are gay""* | *""gay people are f-ing assholes""*

**PLEASE NOTE that we will exercise our own discretion when using this rule. If we do not find a post fitting for this subreddit, it will be removed.**

I could pick out girls between the ages of 16-22, and you wouldnt know which one is a „child“ 

I get that you get turned off by knowing they are underage, but your body cant see the exact age of someone.

Ive heard so many times of guys rejecting girls after they find out they arent 18+

Calling them jailbate 

But they found them attractive at first, are they pedophiles now?

How come they only change they’re mind after they find out the age?


These issues are little more complex that under 18 = pedophile 

Just because someone is telling you how it is, does not mean they are justifying grooming snd sexual assult.


If you cant understand that its not always black or white, or that someone pointing out a flaw in your argument does not mean they have a opinion opposed to yours,

"cancer","t5_2qixx","I’m so sorry you are going through this. I don’t understand why people feel the necessity to share horror stories that are unlikely to be 
helpful and compassionate right now.

I suspect that the stuff about dad not recognizing you would be common during the period where he is near death but again, you will more than likely see symptoms from his lung, liver, and bone Mets prior to this, most notably pain. He may lose his appetite or interest in drinking enough fluids, may have side effects from any meds he may still be on, and again, aching and pain(Bone, chest, abdomen). He may become fatigued, short of breath, lose weight, depressed. But unless he has brain Mets, which is unfortunately very very common in melanoma, he will hopefully be lucid and recognize people who are important to him for the remainder of his life. 

Sure, low oxygen or metabolic changes can cause these things but they can likely be mitigated with oxygen, fluids and electrolyte corrections, etc…. It is also unlikely that he will be so snowed on narcotics to the extent
described, and if you do suspect this, let the professionals step in and balance his pain meds so he can function as he is able and still find relief.  It’s also possible that he enjoys his days up to the end and just passes one day. 

None of this makes it easier though. Wishing you, your father and family the best.",1651363323

He also has leech which is killer for bosses, clan boss, etc. He has a speed aura so can be used as a go first or go second in some arenas depending on the speed you can get him too.

TLDR: He's like Stag Knight but better due to turn meter control, faster cooldown on defense down and leech.",1651363323

If you aren't going to get picked, these days, hang around and put another year on tape, collect some NIL $, work on the things that (obviously) kept all NFL teams from drafting you, and have another shot playing with a Duck team that should again be good. Those two secondary guys returning would be huge (and who knows what kinda year DW might have had with a different QB and offensive staff).

All three look to have enough talent to have some sort of NFL run, leaving early has now left them an uphill battle. That said, obviously another year of school isn't everyone's cup of tea. Maybe the guys were ready to take their shot and were willing to get on with things, if it doesn't happen. I think that happens too.",1651363324

If you feel like sharing would cause more drama or pain for YOU than empathy, don’t. She is your mom for ever, and her priority should always be your well-being over her own.

That said, I’m a mother of little ones. I would absolutely want to know immediately if possible, but latter if that’s what cards we are dealt. I would want to be able to tell me child that I’m sorry I didn’t see the signs of trauma. That I’m sorry they were abused and I was not there to fight for them, protect them, help them find healing and safety. I would want to hold my baby (no matter how big they are, they will always be my babies) and let them feel what they need to feel. 

Discovering my child was abused would break my heart. I would feel intense guilt and pain. But not for myself, for the one I loved and failed. Fit the pain they experienced and the way that changed them.

You need to do what you need to do. And if your mother is a good one, she will do everything she can to give you what you need. Not all parents are good people though, some are selfish, petty and honestly shit people. So if telling her will hurt YOU, don’t. 

I know I rambled. My heart is broke for you. I wish you all the best and hope you find healing.

Now that I think about it, I am really glad, because we can get a new set with energy that would use the same mechanic, but could very well represent anything from regular electricity to some otherworldly magical substance.

"shitposting","t5_2usxq","My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead– murdered by my brother-in-law, Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now, and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, he asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded. I... I always thought Hank was a very moral man, and I was particularly vulnerable at the time – something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me in on a ride-along and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin, so I agreed. Hank had a partner, a businessman named Gustavo Fring. Hank sold me into servitude to this man. And when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling-out. Things escalated. Fring was able to arrange – uh, I guess... I guess you call it a ""hit"" – on Hank, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured. And I wound up paying his medical bills, which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge. Working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring. The bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA. To keep me in line, he took my children. For three months, he kept them. My wife had no idea of my criminal activities, and was horrified to learn what I had done. I was in hell. I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, and in response, he gave me this. [Walt points to the bruise on his face left by Hank in ""Blood Money.""] I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. All I could think to do was to make this video and hope that the world will finally see this man for what he really is.

"survivinginfidelity","t5_2x8ez","First step is ask your stepsister what she meant back then when she asked if you were sure you wanted to marry her, as she clearly knows about something you need to know. 

Second thing you do is go through her phone and see what she has been hiding. 

Third thing is get a DNA test done on your son as if she has been unfaithful, there's no guarantee he's yours. Also get STD/STI tested to be on the safe side. 

Lastly stop making excuses for her actions. I'm pretty sure it says ""I, _____, take you, _____, for my lawful wife/husband, to have and to hold from this day forward, for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, until death do us part. I will love and honor you all the days of my life."" So if she needed someone to lean on it should have been a therapist and a dildo named frank. In no way is it acceptable for her to cheat.

"NoStupidQuestions","t5_2w844","Y’all need to ask the question: what is a calorie? That will answer all other questions.

A calorie is a MEASUREMENT of energy.  Sugar is NOT a calorie, it has the chemical potential to release (or store) that energy in calories.  So most food will be processed for the calories to be burned or stored. 

A stone does not have “calories” because it has no potential for being digested for energy.  Anything else that is edible the can’t be processed for energy, thus does not have “calories”. 

Splenda (a sugar substitute) doesn’t have calories because of a hydroxy group that prevents the body from breaking it down to run through either electron transport chain for ATP. But it still excites our taste buds and tastes sweet.",1651363329

Turkish prove to me a critical partner and I think it's worth it to bring them back to fold rather than demonised/threaten Erdogan. It's the usual for US to do this to countries that go against their wish

And then another similar list that says idk % of bread slice covered in mold on countertop.  And then a couple more for different brands of bread.  And then you write programs to do science so take the whole list and find the mean mode median.   Compare with another list in some way, run a statistical test.

"Male_Studies","t5_3ims3w","&gt;The extent to which trait factors (baseline testosterone concentrations, trait dominance) and state factors (change in social status, change in testosterone concentrations) would predict reactive aggression in a subsequent task that involved provocation was examined in 99 participants (39 men and 60 women). 

&gt;Participants first competed in same-sex dyads on a Number Tracing Task for which the outcome (win or loss) was rigged. After the competition, participants performed the Point Subtraction Aggression Paradigm (PSAP), a behavioural measure of reactive aggression against an opponent (actually a computer program). 

&gt;Trait dominance predicted baseline testosterone in men, but not women, and men made more aggressive responses than did women. 

&gt;Baseline testosterone concentrations did not predict aggressive behaviour in either men or women. 

&gt;Winners and losers did not differ in competition-induced change in testosterone. However, change in testosterone concentrations predicted aggressive responses in the PSAP for men in the loss condition, and aggressive responses were made at a cost to obtaining reward points. 

&gt;For men in the win condition, aggressive responses were predicted by an interaction between trait dominance and change in testosterone concentrations. 

&gt;These findings suggest that situational changes in testosterone concentrations modulate future aggressive behaviour in men.",1651363331

Someone without the people skills to handle being mildly inconvenienced, or the people skills to reschedule if the employer was running significantly late politely, is definitely not worth continuing the conversation with. I don't need someone like that dealing with clients, coworkers or the public at large.

But, also, employers? Don't be late to job interviews: It looks just as bad on you to be late as it does on them.

"NoFap","t5_2skrn","If not watching porn or masturbating gives people the courage and confidence to overcome their anxiety of meeting women or men then so be it. Since the science for masturbation in general is in it's early stages the only real argument that can defend nofap is the placebo effect, which has been proven to work when people believe that a cure will happen.

Berserkers are giant hermit crabs who defend themselves by frantically stabbing with broken weapons they found on the sea floor.

"AmItheAsshole","t5_2xhvq","Friends talk.  But they also **don't** hand out someone else's personal details.  There's no need to even engage in topics that touch on sensitive issues.  And if those subjects **do** happen to come up there are plenty of ways to talk around issues without breaking confidence:

""They're working through some personal stuff.""

""It's really not my place to say/I have to right to say anything more.""

""Look this is a sensitive subject.  How about we talk about something else?""

I've had friends confide in me about mental health crises, personal health issues, being LGBT in an unsafe environment, even sexual assaults they've endured.  You know how many people I've told about these things?  **None.**  Because it's no one else's business unless the person that shared their intimate details with me need to confide in others for some reason or another.

Why in the world would you feel the need to tell other friends about these things anyway?  You have nothing to gain from spilling someone else's secrets and everything to lose.",1651363332

"Psychonaut","t5_2qplv","I guess I would answer the first question with another question: how do you prove that something that is here isn't supposed to be here? (here being in the experience of life as far as any one person's experience allows) Under the assumption that everything is on purpose, otherwise it would be different, starts a person on a quest to understand why things are the way they are, why things happened the way they happened, why things felt the way they did, etc. If you're honest about this process, it will show you the only way anyone believes anything: that they like the ""idea"" of being a person that believes that thing. That, right there is image, which is created by ego.

To answer the second question I'd say that a good rule of thumb to answer any sort of question like that is to  look at nature/reality as a reflection built from the same patterns of which everything else springs from. Therefore, death is likely to be the same as a tree returning to the earth after it has died, and becoming the resources from which new life emerges. With soul/consciousness, however, the concept of ego is eroded away and what is left is energy/emotion. So every plant that comes forth from the nutrients of the dead tree, has ""echos"" of the initial tree that are influencing the growth of the new plants in seemingly imperceptible ways. To apply that to people, you may not entirely be able to pinpoint exactly where in your body and your psyche each of your parents have influenced and to what degree, but it's hard to say there is no influence whatsoever. Just because we can't perceive of how eons of creative energy have mixed and churned in different amounts to eventually form us, doesn't mean that we aren't each of us an amalgamation of the entire system of creation that came before us and continues to influence us in imperceptible ways.

So while you, as an identity, will one day die, the watermark of your experience will persist and influence the course of things from here on, just as you have been so influenced. Therefore, you as a being are never really gone, you just return to the soup of energy from which you came and give to it the wealth of experience that you acquired in this incarnation.

Another way of putting it is this: Each person/being is a cup of water out of the ocean which is one-ness/source. The cup itself is the ego, which prevents the contents of ""you"" from returning immediately to the ocean. The physical counterpart/manifestation of the energetic ego is your physical body. When your body dies, it's like taking that cup of water, which has been subtly altered by its time away from the rest of the ocean, and dumping the water back into the ocean where it becomes mixed up with all the other water of the ocean and adding whatever changes occurred to it to the \*pool\* of experience of the ocean itself. Where reincarnation is concerned is like reaching back into the ocean and pulling out another cup of water. The one major difference between this analogy and reality, however, is that the way energy works is like the connection between the cup of water and the ocean is never truly severed and they ""communicate"" and alter each other in real-time, along with all the other cups(people) that are living. Therefore, living both in a state of isolation and a state of one-ness simultaneously. The difference between the two is where the mind comes in, which is your state of focus. Are you focusing on the cup or the ocean?

Definitely an oversimplification, but I hope that makes some sense.",1651363333

People need to stop invalidating those with diagnosed mental illnesses by saying things like that. Two very close people in my life have diagnosed OCD and it can be debilitating for them at times. Just because someone likes things arranged in a certain way doesn’t mean they have OCD, just like someone who sometimes struggles to focus doesn’t necessarily have ADHD.

"AmItheAsshole","t5_2xhvq","NTA  It's not just a matter of honoring your ancestor's wishes. It's also about current and future family members being able to see and enjoy a piece of your family history, a way to connect.

I have several family jewelry items, they're not all THAT expensive but they're priceless treasures to our family. I get enjoyment out of seeing my daughter wear her grandmother's ""mother's ring"" (which I'd personally never wear). Another daughter is wearing a passed down engagement ring while a vintage ring from her fiance's family is being restored. Even those that aren't worn often are brought out occasionally to enjoy.

It can be complicated deciding who will be the next caretakers of family treasures but my opinion is priority should go to those who will keep them for current and future family to enjoy. Not someone who wants to sell them on.

Would your younger daughter be open to considering gifting the elder a portion, up to half, of what the necklace is valued at? Might be a thoughtful gesture but I wouldn't require it.",1651363334

Take about ten days off for starters. Next time take 300mg every 30 minutes with some small amounts of fats and protein like PB. Or even a tablespoon of olive oil. Yuck yes but it increases absorption. You should start to feel it at the two hour mark and there’s really no reason to go higher than 1800mg.

"AmItheAsshole","t5_2xhvq","I am a choir teacher who helps with our band. Your teacher should never give automatic A's to anyone, but you absolutely could have spoken to her and asked if it were really true or even talked to her to see if she could see that it's ludicrous. I cannot tell you how many times teachers get called to the carpet over kids blowing something out of proportion. Not saying that happened, but you (18F) have to remember that your friends are around the same age and not everything your peers say can be taken at face value. That being said, you not enjoying marching band is tough. Get over it. If your band teacher didn't make those assignments, you would not practice as you should (because you're young, I get it, I've been there) but concert band is a privilege and elective. If you're not willing to do the not fun marching band to continue growing as a musician, you don't get the fun part. If you take a semester off, your playing goes to crap. That's true for even professional musicians. The athletes need to be held to the same standard. I won't say Y T A, but you are not getting by Scott free in this judgement. Talk to your teachers first. We are people too! And if she were to come back at you and retaliate or outright refuse to stop the free A's. Then collect receipts and go to the board. You threw that poor woman to the sharks who look for any reason to come down on teachers.",1651363336

"Scotland","t5_2qkli","&gt; I don't see how not supporting Independence is a betrayal of my working class upbringing?

&gt; I recognise the value of the assistance that society has afforded me through working tax credits whilst I was brought up, receiving payments for going school, free university education, I am massively in favour of all these things.

Current WM model is to withdraw that support at every turn and to inveigle private enterprise, ergo profit motive, which generally is the first step to user pays. You may be in favour of everything you've mentioned but the status quo is to in favour of removing those. Labour in power won't be the saviour of these programmes, Starmer is Tory lite®™ and is surprised why his party loses votes in favour of the full strength Tory.

&gt; Had I said that I thought people should be paying for education, not receive benefits and such then that would be hypocritical.

Yet your desire to not rock the boat is a vote in support of all of the things you don't want to happen eventuating. 

&gt; I think we might be on different pages here, I amsayingthat I think that I dependence will cause deep, deep fiscal issues in this country, publicsector spending will be rolled back - this includes the very programmes that I have personally benefitted from - by voting yes as I currently see it iwould be putting at risk the ability of other poorer members of society from getting the leg up that I did.

News flash - those programmes have been being unwound since long before you were born. Social mobility has reduced since the 1980s. That is the status quo that you are in favour of. 

&gt; I am under no illusion that I would not be where I am without the above.

But you are disillusioned if you think that, absent a massive change in direction at Westminster, these programmes are not being whittled away by a thousand cuts. 2008 to 2020 saw massive austerity, ""for the good of the children"", ""because the cupboard was bare"" yet billions have just been magicked out of the air, wasted on PPE programmes that were just steam in a bucket. The programmes that did society good - ""too expensive, can't afford"". The programmes that have done the Cabinet's mates good - ""We'll have a dozen please and don't skimp on the gravy"".

&gt; We fundamentally disagree on what we think Independence will do financially and socially to the fabric of this country. There's nothing wrong with that. I want what's best for me and my fellow citizens, I do not think a complete severance from the UK is the answer to that.

There's nothing wrong with disagreement, but when that disagreement is based on myopic and subjective personal benefits versus the greater good then it's not a meaningful discussion and it's the reason that you are being called selfish. 

&gt; Intermediate less drastic steps and evaluating the costs and benefits of the changes is the way forward in my opinion. Independence is not the magic but and neither do I beleive it to be the correct launching point for greater prosperity for the wider population of the country.

Your argument is based on the premise that Scotland is being offered something instead of pursuing independence, it's not, it is being offered the same shit sandwich of the last 40 years whilst being told ""it'd be madness"". Madness is doing the same things repeatedly expecting a different outcome. The very things that you claim got you where you are today, are being whittled away slice by slice, everything means tested despite the administration of means testing being more expensive than the actual programme they are administering, demonisation of the poor because there are deserving and undeserving 

If you think you're safe from the BS of Westminster because you've got a house and a nice job then go and google [Black Wednesday Exchange Rate Mechanism Crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Wednesday). Interest rates increased by 50% from an already eye watering 10% to 15% in a single day. Your stability is illusory and entirely in the hands of an English electorate, never Scotland's, Englands economic needs will always come before Scotland's.",1651363336

I'm somewhat fitness focused but it's not a major lifestyle for me. I run or bike or walk a few times a week, maybe do a little yoga. But it's kind of secondary compared to being in an office full time and doing more indoor stuff like art and music.  But fitness stuff is one of the few uses I know of that comes with a wearable, so it's hard for me not to prioritize that more since I'm still trying to figure out what all a smart watch can do for me.",1651363337

Take both hands, and follow this sequence:

(1) Gently tap above your eyebrows for 2-3 seconds.

(2) Now tap the sides of your eyes, near the temple. 2-3 seconds.

(3) Then move to under your eyes and tap for 2-3 seconds.

(4) Next, tap above your lip/under your nose for 4-5 seconds.

(5) Now tap your chin for 4-5 seconds.

(6) Move to your collarbone, and tap for 5-6 seconds on your collar bone.


Use your right hand to tap on your left hand in this way:

(7) Tap the side of your left index finger a few times.

(8) Then move to your middle finger and tap.

(9) Tap your ring finger too.

(10) Now your pinky.

Repeat the process as much as you need to.
When you do this, it disrupts the electron signals leading to the brain, creating a block inbetween emotions and function. I find this very helpful to prevent a burnout/meltdown or when I'm feeling overwhelmed. I hope this helps.",1651363337

That's all well and good, but if your wife is giving you ultimatums, *she does not respect you.*

&gt;The response that I got back from so many dumb fucking rednecks in this group was to get a new wife or grow a pair. Mod.... you will remove me, I get it. But those that said that... but happy you don't know me.

We're glad we don't know you if you're some jackass that's gonna call us a bunch of ""dumb fucking rednecks."" This community is occupied by a diverse group of individuals with varying life experiences and education.

They're warning you about your wife because they've seen this song and dance before. Your relationship with your wife and your wife's trauma aren't all that special, and ultimatums usually play out the same way. It's controlling behavior, and is generally a red flag. 

If you want to give up your guns for your wife, good for you, but we're not going to pat you on the back for it. 

You've mentioned you derive a great deal of enjoyment from firearms, that's important. If you don't expect she'd make a similar concession regarding anything she derives great enjoyment from, you might have chosen the wrong wife. 

You've clearly been in a relationship for some time if you're married, so why is this only coming up now that you tied the knot? Did the suicide *just* happen? If so, can you store those guns with a friend to see if she is someone who's going to recognize she's overreacting a few months down the line? 

If you really, really want pellet or airsoft guns, I'd check out /r/airguns and /r/airsoft to see what they recommend. Some of us might, but most of us don't know much about them. You wouldn't go to the motorcycle subreddit to ask about bicycles.",1651363337

(Can provide name, race, and info if wanted). 

Additionally I have the option for my PC's to spend downtime training at the Mariner's Guild to specialize in Officer training, which grants them a feat associated to the Officer (like Chef for the Cook Officer) and being an officer makes them able to serve as a Captain.

After that I have them sailing to Chult and back between some missions, to fight pirates and run around Port N. Also I made T Dog's Fate and the Styes happen on islands between Saltmarsh and Chult. So when they run into other mysterious islands, that where they find upgrades for thier ships as well guarded loot.

"CompetitiveForHonor","t5_3bbel","Because 4v4s are trash and unbalanced garbage when compared to duels, plain and simple really. 4v4s is so ""turn your brain off"" gameplay compared to actually have to pay attention in 1v1 where everything actually matters. In 4s, I can be losing and run away for a powerup, pull out a feat and insta turn the fight, get my teammates to come gank you while im losing or winning, have a perk that makes me stronger than you with no skill, etc.

4s isn't designed to be balanced and can never be balanced with this game's combat style, therefore it's better to focus on the actual balanced part of the game which is the 1v1 aspect. At most the game can be balanced around 2v2, anything more than that just turns into a spam fest full of nonsense and abuse of the combat system that's designed around 1v1.

The only way to give 4v4s a balance for kits is to add little niche things that make 4v4s manageable, like gryphons hyper armor on parry or zhanhus wide hitrange on his heavies or bulwark counter consistently countering multiple attacks, etc. You make a kit for 1v1 as a base line and design everything around that, and then add additions to the kit to make them better in 4v4s.

---

---

# Posts with low effort truth statements are not allowed.

Your submission is considered ""low effort."" This doesn't inherently mean that it was *irrelevant* to r/technicallythetruth, but instead it was removed because it fit one or more of these criteria:

* Short, minimal-effort text posts like ""a water bottle without water is an air bottle"". Most, if not all text posts can and will be removed.

* Asking for upvotes, or saying things like ""sort by new"", ""let's get to the front page"", or anything related to cake days or karma.

* [Meta memes](https://imgur.com/qgkCskm), or any other post that tries to be clever by mentioning r/technicallythetruth.

* [Images that are hard to look at](https://imgur.com/yuMwr8a) because they are poorly made, deep-fried, or poorly cropped.

**Your submission could have also been removed because it is overdone:**

* Statements that say something like ""at least twelve"": [example 1](https://imgur.com/K1ZwEAv) | [example 2](https://imgur.com/dIkwEpU)

* Common statements that begin with ""on average..."": *the average amount of hands a person has is less than two* | *each person has, on average, one testicle and one boob*

* Low effort misunderstandings of everyday phrases: *How high are you  --&gt; ""I'm 5 foot 9""* 

* Common insults that are meant literally as opposed to being insulting: *""homosexuals are gay""* | *""gay people are f-ing assholes""*

**PLEASE NOTE that we will exercise our own discretion when using this rule. If we do not find a post fitting for this subreddit, it will be removed.**

Even after the 4 days I spent another 3 on the couch because I'm a stomach sleeper and didn't want to jostle anything around.

"webdev","t5_2qs0q","Treat it like the web design Bible. It works. 

Also for spacing. I always make the padding top and bottom of my mobile sections 50px. Then tablet 75px, and desktop 100-150px top and bottom. Spacing needs to be even, and consistent. Don’t just make it up as you go. Have a spacing system. Love on some sites I choose a factor of 8. So if I have a heading, I Make it’s margin Bottom like 24-30px (units divisible by 8), and the paragraphs margin bottom to have about half. So if the margin bottom of the heading is 36px, half is 18px. The closest factor of 8 is 16px or 24px. So I’d choose 24px. Then if there’s two paragraphs and a button at the end of the second paragraph, I’d set the last paragraph to have a margin bottom of 36px (match the spacing between the header and the first paragraph). It’s symmetrical that way. It feels right. 

By using spacing as multiples of a number you create a cohesive design system. You can use whatever you want. Multiples of 4, 6, 5. Doesn’t matter. I like 4, 6, and 8. When using all your spacing and sizing based on a multiple of a number, everything feels much more proportional and like it’s makes sense. 

Also, paragraph line height sweet spot is 1.5em. Headings should be 1.5-2.5X the paragraph font size Below it. Big and bold too. I generally make my headings 32-48px and either bold or black form weight.",1651363344

The local paper had the ""normal"" ads with a few ""personal"" one, but people had to supply full name/address/contact details &amp; sign form for legal purposes, so most were fairly tame. The was however a country wide paper that came out twice a week which had ""sensational"" stories on front page, a page 3 topless girl/s about 8-12 pages in the centre were Tue paper listed greyhound racing details and Fri paper had horse racing details and the back pages had adverts from selling livestock (racing industry), making contacts, friends &amp; also sex, stripper, porn publications/media etc. but all very tame in wording with a lot of initials signifying the ""services"", which made them basically legal and also save on ad costs as they were charged by words/lines &amp; the shorter, the cheaper.

A few years late 2 magazines came out, full of bizarre &amp; ""deviant"" stories, sexy topless women's photos etc. and at the rear were all the usual pay per minute ads for sex/escorts both male, female &amp; ""other""  kinks. The started including personal ads that had all the sgl, couple, group meetups, swingers parties, models etc and photos could be included for extra fees and a ""box number"" included for initial contact. Pressure from religious groups meant when personal ads were included which included genitals, the magazines had to be rated 18+ to purchase and they were also in sealed plastic bags and is explicit covers, they had to have an insert to cover ""offending"" image. The also increased dramatically in price &amp; had to be on top shelves of magazine rack, out of the reach or minors.

Generally the wording was fairly tame, but photos &amp; services were pretty explicit and the magazines outsold publications like Playboy &amp; similar. Strangely, when these magazines came out nudist/naturist magazines were no longer in plastic &amp; could be on lower shelves with sports &amp; leisure magazines, but showed as many pics of genitals as the others, although supposedly not of a sexual nature.

I think McCreary was a head scratcher, but if he’s good then so what. 

I’m a fan of drafting the future LT hopeful now, I never want to see a rookie starting there, so we need to be ahead of Lewans departure. I’m not worried about the interior OL like a lot of folks. IOL is a low value position compared to OT. I’d rather take picks on OT and plug and play G. 

Thrilled about Chig, it’s never bad to have athletes like that in the team. Dudes gonna put on some weight and be a freak Te if I had to guess. 

Willis was a phenomenal pick/steal, the value there is near impossible to measure.  

I’ll say this, one of these teams who took a qb got the steal of a life time and don’t even know it yet could very well be us. Someone got a franchise star at Qb this weekend. 

Also, the reach for Haskins was a little long IMO there were still real contribution level Wr’s there when we took him that didn’t fall to our next pick while he most definitely would. But it’s just time I accept this is a run first real and that’s Jrobs focus everything else is secondary so I get why he did it. 

I’m hoping as things get rolling we hear positive things about Woods, we’re definitely going to need him as our X,  while Burks develops his route tree into an NFL route tree.",1651363345

Nobody should be taking that long to earn a black belt. That makes NO sense. Especially, when you consider how recent Taekwon-Do is and the fact that NO Korean instructor of Taekwon-Do, from it's inception,  took 8 years to earn a black belt.

The people that taught you or the people that taught them didn't take 8 years to earn a black belt. So, why should you or anyone else take that long?",1651363345

"CodeGeass","t5_2tjxg","You are using outside knowledge that the Black Knights do not possess.  Schneizel acts as if the FLEIJA was necessary.  Of course we know he always wanted it to drop but the BKs don't.  He plays the warhead aboatd hos plane as if it is just for protection.  He could have just eliminated them there but didn't.  He actively walked into the line of fire just to negotiate.  Schneizel is really good at keeping his facade, the BKs did not know his true nature.  

Audios can be manipulated, doesn't mean there isn't some truth to them.  The Black Knights were already on thin-ice with Zero.  He did accidentally orchestrate the SAZ massacre.  Lelouch gives a direct reason for why he would orchestrate the massacre.  With sentences like that it would be hard to manipulate without some scuffedness.  The audio wasn't the only thing.

Zero blew up General Katase's ship and killed the other JLF leader.  Diethard knew he did this.  Tohdoh knew Katase would never have done that suicide rush.  

Zero did know of the FLEIJA.  Suzaku directly tells him about it and Zero decided to attack him anyways.  It is in the Lancelot's audio logs.  It wouod show as beimg umtampered with which would be proof.  The BKs did not know about Suzaku beating up Lelouch(which was actually to join him), all they know is Lelouch went to meet with Suzaku, confessed and was captured.  We know the FLEIJA was Schneizel's fault, the Black Knights do not.  Suzaku had a clearly mounted large weapon onboard the Lancelot.  It was clearly visible.  Suzaku warned him before they started to fight.  Lelouch in a fit of rage had Kallen attack him anyways.  Watching the battle would show that Zero and Kallen were the only ones engaging Suzaku at the moment.  

Lelouch said that, doesn't change the BKs morality about it.  There were innocent scientists that merely could have been forced to do that.  They killed children who did infact die.  

Euphemia has broken up fights before and actively showed her disdain for Britannia's actions in public.  Her reputation was that of an innocent princess.

They knew that Zero was not 100% on their side.  They knew he had mind control powers, just not the specific nechanisms of it other than it relies on eye-contact.  They were prepared and from their view jistified in the actions they took.",1651363345

"UnsentLetters","t5_2seir","Dear users of /r/UnsentLetters,

For the rest of April 2022, the mods have set every submission to be locked automatically except for the stickied comment you see here. The subreddit is overrun with people who believe every letter is         for them and respond as such, which is a violation of rule #7. While there are a few users who are very kind, sweet, or empathetic towards the people posting their letters, there are a lot of people           being complete assholes to the OP, which violates several of our rules. There are also a bunch of trolls who make multiple accounts to post here and it's weird. Please report these to us when you see           them!

You can read the [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/about/rules/) here. We have these stickied to EVERY POST and nobody reads them. **READ THEM**

At the end of April we will enable commenting again and have the community vote on whether comments should be allowed again or we make the locked threads a permanent thing.

Take care and read the damn rules.

Aber in der Praxis, da es auch so bereits etabliert ist und zwecks Schutz v.a. von Frauen ist das schwer umzusetzen.

Dazu gibt es allerdings einen (meines Halbwissens nach) logischen Grund für die Vorschrift der Bedeckung von primären Geschlechtsorganen: Hygiene. Ich glaube, dass Badehosen die Übertragung von verschiedenen Krankheiten, u.a. v.a.  Papillomviren, die auch für sexuell übertragbare Krankheiten verantwortlich sind, reduzieren.

"Ben10","t5_2ub0g","The first thing I loved about Cannonbolt was the fact that his appearance opened a whole new world of different aliens Ben could transform into. The whole franchise's name revolves around the number 10 and the fact that Ben could turn into 10 aliens, so an 11th one simply made all us kids go bonkers with how that established rule was being broken.

The second thing was that Cannonbolt was always a savior/saving grace/wildcard/callback in almost all his appearances. His very first appearance had him save the world by killing a parasite none of the others could defeat. He then gave Kevin a surprise when it looked like Kevin was finally going to kill Ben. Later he made an appearance again when Ben got Benwolf/Blitzwolfer and I always thought that was a reference to the fact that Cannonbolt was the original new alien. Then his reappearance during the Highbreed war was another fond callback. He was also the first alien Ben's dad saw Ben become in that original series alternate timeline episode. 

Cannonbolt is awesome, although his Ultimate form isnt.

Since I'm on this, we need to see the Biomnitrix make a fusion of Cannonbolt with Terraspin and one with Diamondhead.",1651363350

"mormon","t5_2qky2","&gt;This is false. Joseph Smith did not say anything about Heavenly Mother. Jeremiah is not talking about Heavenly Mother. Brigham young taught that Eve is Heavenly Mother.

Some early Latter-day Saint women recalled that he personally taught them about a Mother in Heaven. (Susa Young Gates, History of the Young Ladies’ Mutual Improvement Association of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints \[Salt Lake City: Deseret News, 1911\], 15–16.)

In 1909, the First Presidency taught that “all men and women are in the similitude of the universal Father and Mother (singular).

Susa Young Gates, a prominent leader in the Church, wrote in 1920 that Joseph Smith’s visions and teachings revealed the truth that “the divine Mother (Singular), \[is\] side by side with the divine Father.”

And of course we have all of the more modern Prophets who all give examples of singular Mother in Heaven. 

Brigham young was wrong, or we don't understand what he meant by his statements. Adam God Theory has been thoroughly rejected by the church. 

&gt; Brigham young taught that if a man didn't want to engage in plural marriage, but rather stick to monogamous marriage, that the man would lose his wife when he got to heaven.

Brigham Young thoroughly believed that those who didn't support plural marriage in their hearts, would be punished in the hereafter. But that even if they didn't practice polygamy they could still be exalted.

President Young said there would be men saved in the Celestial Kingdom of God with one wife with Many wives &amp; with No wife at all.

He said a Man may Embrace the Law of Celestial Marriage in his heart &amp; not take the Second wife &amp; be justified before the Lord.

And many people disagreed that plural marriage was necessary at all:

George Q. Cannon, a member of the First Presidency, noted in 1884 that ""he believed there would be men in the Celestial Kingdom that had but one wife,"" and in 1900 a counselor to Wilford Woodruff remembered Brigham Young ""proposed that we marry but one wife."" Cannon said that ""I am perfectly satisfied there are men who will be counted worthy of that glory who never had a wife; there are men probably in this world now, who will receive exaltation, who never had a wife at all, or probably had but one.

Joseph Smith Never taught that plural marriage was essential for exaltation. 

And of course currently the church doesn't practice polygamy, so if it is a requirement for exaltation that would be odd. 

The views of The Living Church have evolved, and it's teachings have evolved, and more truth has been revealed over time. 

My views don't contradict the teachings of the church, just as the modern views of the church don't contradict the old views of the church, but they are certainly different than what was taught during Brigham Young's time, and based on more light and knowledge. 

My views, I am confident, happily combine all of the church's practices From Joseph Smith, in the past, and the modern day practices of sealing without marriage, and monogamous relations. 

The view of Brigham Young while accurate was not complete. And so as a result you can see that he erroneously believed that men would be punished on one hand if they didn't believe in polygamy in their heart, while at the same time admitting that single men would be saved in the celestial kingdom as well, as those with multiple marriages, and those with only one wife. 

Both statements of Brigham Young are true, but his perception that plural marriage was necessary was incorrect. He simply didn't have the full view. Looking back at history we have the benefit of learning that sealings are not necessarily only provided in marriage.",1651363350

I'll show you where the difference is. Abu Lahab is somebody who opposed Muhammad and was an actual enemy of Islam. 

Ibn 'Abbas is literally claimed to be the greatest mufassir of Qur'an. If one of / the greatest mufassir of the Quran is telling us that the Gospel and Torah are preserved and cannot be changed, then you should probably listen to him. I'd have to see an actual argument against what 'Abbas said, because I think his interpretation fits perfectly with Muhammad in Quran 3:3, 5:47, 5:68, and 7:157.

*PLEASE NOTE I DO NOT MIND BEING CURVY. BUT I WANT TO BE HEALTHIER. I DONT THINK ILL EVER BE MY 130lb I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL. WHEN I HAD AN EATING DISORDER. BUT BETTER.*

Hi there, I’m new to this forum. I’m looking for some advice. So I‘ll try to make this as concise as possible. 3 1/2 years ago, my mom passed away. Then a year and an a half later my dad passed away. My pos ex of 3, almost 4 years. Cheated on me, in the midst of me grieving my losses. Then at the end of Dec, my uncle. The last parental figure I have. Had a major stroke, and is expected to potentially be wheel chair bound. 

I was a caretaker for both my folks, to varying degrees. And have been working on things for my uncle. I thank god he’s stable now, and in a rehab center. Suffice to say. I feel like shit, on top of shit. Has been piled on me.

I took over my family home/mortgage at 24. I’m now 28. And I’m trying to maneuver my way through somewhat early adulthood alone. My childhood was tumultuous. But I’ve tried to focus on the good. And the blessings I do have.

Recently my finances have become strained. And i don’t want to lose what I’ve maintained since my mom passed. I have been working with a psychiatrist, to work on my mental health. Most days it’s hard to get out of bed. But I really want to get ahead of this problem. Before it gets any worse.

HERE’S THE QUESTION!:

So I’ve gained weight, and want to drop some weight. Eat healthier, etc. and most of my previous jobs have been in an office/administrative setting. So I was thinking of getting a job that is more physical in labor. Less mentally taxing. Would also be a way to be more physical. Incentive to get out of this funk. Pack healthy lunches. All while getting some money, to help my financial situation in the meantime. Until further notice? Has anyone tried this? How was ur experience? What are your thoughts? I need help, and I’m just scared of loosing everything. (except for the weight. Lol)",1651363351

"audioengineering","t5_2qkby","When building a studio, it doesn't really matter whether you're the one playing the instruments or someone else is. What matters is what the studio is intended to do.

In what physical space will the studio exist? Do you have a budget in mind?

Practically speaking, it largely depends on what/who you plan on recording. If you're recording singers, singer-songwriters, or rappers mostly, you realistically don't need very much in terms of I/O. An Apollo Twin is a very very common rig for smaller studios that are aimed at rappers and singers/singer-songwriters recording to music produced ""in the box"" (meaning using the DAW, midi, plugins, etc). You'd be surprised how much of the music you hear from bigger artists is made using an Apollo Twin and a mic alone, as far as physical gear. An acoustic guitar, electric guitar, vocals...all of that can be done and done well with an Apollo Twin alone.

If I read your post correctly, though, you are looking for a studio that can mold to any artist or band. If you're looking to be able to record actual full bands (read: live drums) then you will obviously need a much bigger space and more I/O. You can start with a bunch of mic stands, mic cables, a handful of headphones, a headphone distribution system, a pair of overhead mics (ribbon or SDC I'd recommend), a vocal mic (LDC), and a few SM57s. And of course, most importantly, you'll want a room that sounds at least decent and is treated as best as possible (bass trapping, absorption)

A set of studio monitors and a computer are obviously necessary as well.

As far as I/O and the digital part of the studio, it all depends how much you want to spend. On the dirty cheap end, you can use a live mixer - like you're used to - and just sum everything down to two channels and go into your computer fully mixed.

Hi!
What I need help with: 
I feel like I’m very inconsistent in looking good, only with specific angles and with makeup. I can’t bring myself to do anything more than like, liner for an everyday look without feeling gross. Anything on my skin that’s not my lips or eyes (don’t do my brows but want to, I feel like I could balance my face better if I learned) definitely hate mascara now, especially on my soft face.

The general education classes do the same thing but about how the world works and ways to think about the world. I think you would have preferred a trade school. It focuses on the job skills without going to deep into the theoretical. I appreciate the theoretical side of my field (English Literature), so I appreciated the  electives and theoretical courses. I think it would be best to promote trade schools for those with an analytical mind and promote colleges for theoretically minded people. Also if we can work as a society to destigmatize trade schools as the dumb people option, and treat it as a bachelors degree but in an applied field.",1651363356

If the device is yours and not managed by your employer/organization, and your employer allows VPN connections, *and* you don't need to VPN to your employer

Then because of the way a VPN works, it will hide your IP address location for some methods from your employer ***if you connect through the location you want to show you are at.*** Most if not all VPNs give you many options of what country you'd like to connect through, so for example if you wish to ""pretend"" you're in the US you'd connect through a US Server. However, that's not typically good enough location wise as it'll show you as connecting from the general location of the VPN server, which could be anywhere in the US (have fun explaining why your IP address is showing as coming from Chicago, IL or Miami, FL). Just note that there are other methods of determining your location depending on the level of access your employer has to your device that a VPN won't/can't change, (such as GPS, etc.) but most don't bother or care.",1651363357

#SERIOUSLY READ THIS WHOLE THING

Your post was removed due to the New/Inactive User filter. This is in place due to how large the subreddit is, and with that bringing hordes of spam/reposts/advertising etc...

The filter removes posts from accounts that have less than 2000 karma and that are less than 2 weeks old.
What you need in order to post (YOU NEED BOTH OF THESE):

* 2000 combined **post &amp; comment** karma - ***award karma DOES NOT COUNT***. We don't care if the app says you have 1900. ***It is wrong.***

* You can check your karma here:  http://old.reddit.com/user/Careful-Air-5738/overview

* Wait for your account to be 2 weeks old

You can get karma by commenting on posts or posting in other subreddits and getting upvotes on either (Reddit's version of likes).

Directly asking people for upvotes isn't allowed, and you will be banned for it.

I will just say I highly disagree that ethanol isn’t all bad.  It’s one of the worst extraction methods for high quality with the cannabis plant.  Every time someone uses ethanol extraction, their are superior methods of extraction they could use instead.  

Co2 extraction is done at 1,500-5,000 PSI, and it just isn’t a good application for cannabis.  Due to the nature of co2 it has to be repeatedly passed over the trichomes structure at that amount of pressure, and it just doesn’t have a great solubility with the trichomes structure.  And I want to clarify, when I say repeatedly passed over, I’m not talking a handful of times…I’m talking a minimum of 2 hours under that pressure. 

Ethanol extractions real problem is just the high boiling point, being purged off at 175F is very rough on the compounds, and exactly why it burns dirty and hits harsh.  

Hydrocarbon extraction is by far the superior solvent extraction method, and has the most/best applications on the cannabis plant.  Low pressure of around 100 PSI, and a low boiling point at around 40F for a butane/propane blend.  

That’s enough science for me today…it’s my day off!",1651363358
"SkincareAddicts","t5_37kq2","Unfortunately that dermatologist did not know how. 

This does not mean it can not be done. 

They were probably well intentioned, but it is possible for a doctor to be well intentioned and be wrong.

I have sucessfully removed lesions like this from many clients, who were slso told by their detmatolists that the lesions coukd not be removed without  scarring.

I have erased stretch marks and those clients were slso told that there is no cure for stretch matks. I gabe fixused on treating this problem for more than 10 years and have found a way to get rid of them. 

Ask for proof. A doctor who claims to ve able to have solved a problem shpukd be able to show you proof. If they can’t, go with someone who you do trust. 

As a symbol of good faith i always try to give clients an early win. Once I fix one problem for the client, they trust that i want to give them more wins. 

When you treat eaxh person like a VIP, and make them feel that their beauty treatment success is what you take pride in delivering, you begin to build a solid relationship. 

When, like a singer’s who believes she is only as good as her last performance, a docyor strives to meet and exceed each client’s beauty or rejuvenation goals, only then, does that doctor win the client’s loyalty, and be given more opportunites to prove their skill and artistic and technical talents. 

Repeat business is am earned privilege, earned by promising, delivering, and exceeding each client’s expectations. 

It is my opinion that doctors need to listen more to what clients want, and then determine whether they can deliver the desired result, and be transparent about how long it will take for them to deliver that result.",1651363358
"Indiana","t5_2qn7d","White people - especially men - are pissed off that the world has changed. They expected to keep all of the power, and being told they have to share feels like an attack. Because they feel entitled to have it all - it’s their identity. 

Power = control over conversations, control over content in schools, control over social norms. Control over what matters in the reality we construct. 

Last week my cousin posted something about being glad Musk bought fb.  When I asked why, his friends chimed in with a bunch of pro-Trump bs. When I shared Twitter’s statement explaining the Trump ban and connecting it to 1/6, my cousin deleted the thread. And then he made an unintentionally ironic, angry post complaining about censorship. 

Introducing a reality outside of their bubble is perceived as an attack. I think they feel under attack all of the time. 

This is the same cousin who caused a huge family riff a decade ago when he sent a second racist “joke” email, having been told after sending the first one to knock it off. 

He also fails to comprehend why his daughter can’t proselytize at her elementary school, yet biology teachers can discuss gender. 

I block these people. I don’t know what else to do. Illusions are vastly more important than reality - it’s human nature to live within illusions. They’re just being human. With disastrous results.

Ultimately, I’m not sure it’s always up to us to punish someone else for bad behavior. The more people recognize they deserve to be treated like human beings, the less they will put up with toxic or abusive people. And those toxic and abusive people will have less and less people in their lives that they can bully. Eventually, their behavior will be punishment enough when they look around and realize that they are alone. 

And yeah, it definitely doesn’t go both ways with genders.

"TooAfraidToAsk","t5_2ssp7","It's either called the ""White Savior Complex"" or ""White Knighting"". I don't really know why we/they do it (I'm mixed race). 

Personally I find it really frustrating when a non-Māori person tries to tell me when I should or shouldn't be offended by something. It can be as simple as them getting offended on my behalf. Like, yes it's offensive if someone makes a mockery of my culture (for example mocking our Haka) but it's almost as offensive for me to have a non-Māori person get pissed off at a genuine attempt by someone to respect my culture. For example, my brother in law exclaimed offense to me by a tour guides pronunciation of a Māori word (which I didn't have a problem with since the tour guide actually gave it a really good try and was teaching about the traditional Māori stories of the area) which was very irritating for me. I very nearly told him off for being offended on behalf on my people... 

Anyway, yeah it's frustrating when you see genuine attempts at respecting or learning of your culture be shut down by other people not of that culture just because the first person in question was not of that culture either (you can interchange culture with race in that sentence).

At the start of the pandemic a group of people who were already distrustful of vaccines (or government, or western medicine, or who had paranoid or narcissistic tendencies) found each other and decided that the pandemic wasn’t real; that it was a nefarious plan by governments to “control” the population. Later on a majority of them decided that maybe it was real but that the government was using it as cover for something bad and that the vaccine was poison. They concocted wild stories and showed everyone that they weren’t “sheep” by refusing to wear masks or get vaccinated. They were convinced that they were right, and employed every type of logical fallacy to convince others. Meanwhile they became an easy target for grifters and state-sponsored misinformation that’s designed specifically to create social upheaval. Everyone else got vaccinated and wore masks because they didn’t want to get Covid and they realized that by doing these things they could help prevent vulnerable people from getting sick or dying. 

Now the virus has mutated into a bunch of far less dangerous variants, and governments have mostly removed any mandates. But these people, like you, are still convinced that the government is persecuting them, even as everything returns to normal. It can be difficult to face the gap between expectations and reality, but you need to start facing it: you and your friends were wrong about almost everything, and you’re completely out of step with the vast majority of society.",1651363360

Sleek, metallic body, beautiful screen, great specifications, amazing camera. I dropped it many times, without the screen ever cracking. (well until it finally did, after three years of constant, rough use)

I used to be a real fanboy, used to love going on the forums, discussing the phone with others, asking questions and answering them. 

After my OP3 was finally put to rest, I bought THE MOST BEAUTIFUL PHONE I've ever seen. Indian variant of the OnePlus 7T Pro McLaren edition. Still wonderful OS, great camera, top notch specs, unique pop-up selfie camera, mesmerizing body with those orange accents, wonderful touches here and there that truly made the phone a joy and delight to own. Such as the braided charging cable and the carbon fibre and alcantara case. 

I've been using my OP7T Pro just as I used my previous phone, and still in love with it. But it's starting to show it's age: the battery dies faster, warp charging sometimes doesn't work, the camera is no longer as good as it used to be. I'll use it for as long as it lasts, probably even send it for servicing. But after that, I don't think I'm buying another phone from OnePlus.

Each year, I've eagerly watched OnePlus launch events, hoping they do something good again. Each year I'm disappointed. Some of the reasons are:

OnePlus doing away with the pop-up camera. 

The first few batches of OnePlus 8 and 9 phones having display problems.

OnePlus merging with Oppo. (Especially hate the merger of Oxygen OS and Colour OS. OP said that the OSs will be separate, but under a single dev team. Hah)

Carl Pei leaving OnePlus.

Prices matching other flagships. 

Nothing really unique. 

OnePlus was once a phone company with a niche following of tech nerds with tight pockets. Now it's a phone company that wants to cater to everyone. That might be in the company's best interests, but OnePlus and many of its long-term costumers don't align with each other. 

Thank you for everything so far, OnePlus. Thank you for two great phones, 6 years of great memories. I'll be looking at Samsung for my next phone.",1651363360

I have few Chinese friends myself in Germany but unfortunately only one out of three is actually willing to admit that China is doing ANY shit. Might be different for you. They are good people but become extremely distant and even aggressive if I talk about how politics in China is fucked up. Unfortunately most Chinese I talked to in my life are either ""I don't deal or care with/about politics"" or telling me I am racist or influenced by the wests propaganda when I  criticize ANYTHING about China or their leadership. 

So if the people who studied in Germany and lived for a decade here are like that I would prefer not to do any business with China anymore. Shutdown any contact to autocracies around the world.

No one cared about the likes of Kinkaku and Ginkaku tbh. The war arc revived too many insignificant characters leading to many scattered and frankly disinteresting battles. Madara and masked Obito were the ones who pretty much carried the war arc.

I was 56yr old 5’11” was 275 lbs when I started quit looking at scale

now at 58 am 175-180 lbs :) same as I was in my 20s 30s 40s

Never thought I could be the same as I was in super shape of my younger years as I also had a goal of around 200 thinking OH I am over 55 and everyone told me you can never look like you did in your 20s !

Well sure my face looks older but same clothing size and weight and very good muscle tone truly blown away where I am never thought this could happen

I did OMAD mostly and still do as I never get hungry enough and if I do I go ahead and eat but its rare took a bit to get a really good handle on proper full

best of luck keep it up you can do it just commit to it ! And I do say you could get to your proper best body weight just keep at it

again for me the huge things I did not think would happen is the no more brain fog no more joint pains in the morning no OH I have to get my body moving feel anymore I just wake up and am up and flexible etc...

also no more after eating crashes on the couch no naps needed sleep is way better etc... also if I do hard yard work I recover like my youth the next day I am fine not OH NO 3 days of pain its GONE

as other said do not do the keto snacks if you can :)

I went to a museum with my daughter the other day and there was a children’s garden to walk through but all she wanted to do was sit in the dirt and pick it up and drop it over and over again. After many attempts to get her to walk through with me I realized it was a me problem. We didn’t have a schedule, there’s no harm in sitting in the dirt, and if this is what she wanted to do, I just had to be patient and let her. Like the chocolate at breakfast or the haphazard butterflies. What’s the harm and if it makes them feel a little in control and like they have some autonomy, it sounds like a win to me.",1651363361

Good idea to give yourself some time to mull over her question though. Go with your heart. Take the relationship slowly and see what develops. 

Whilst this is happening you could learn to be more relaxed if you find relationships a bit like a taught tightrope, so as to speak. I prefer Dr Ainslie Meares' meditation method that reduces tension and anxiety by relaxation of body and mind so the mind slows down and becomes still. Meares, an eminent psychiatrist, writes in some of his books that many patients were helped by learning deep mental relaxation in social situations and relationship situations like that which you mention. Meares has passed away but his books (eg Ainslie Meares on Meditation) explain how to experience this deeply relaxing calm, if you want to know more about it. It requires daily practice eg 10 mins or so twice a day over a period of time and you will get glimpses, over time the glimpses lengthen and deepen.",1651363362

I have seen kids who should have been taken from abusive, drug abuse filled homes that weren't due to the strained, poorly funded system and more often than not they end up in a generational mess due to no fault of their own.

 Bad adoptive parents exist and the regulation in many cities/countries is subjective (however has improved in many! It is expensive and challenging but this is because adoption is a major change in a child's life and is not like adopting an animal, this is a human being) but leaving children in bad situations and hoping things work out due to ""maternal connection to your birth monther"" who literally may not be able to support a lifetime and commitment does not benefit the child/infant at all. 

Anecdotally speaking a fiend of mine adopted a 13 year old boy on her own when she was in her early 30s, dude has all the supports he needs and has zero attachment issues related to his birth mother and has an excellent relationship with his adoptive mother. This type of garbage is what keeps kids in a shitty foster care system.",1651363362

"ontario","t5_2qsf3","At least you are trying to learn adulting and honestly you should have learned this in HS, I know people who live there whole lives and never figure out how taxes work.

The amount they withhold from you is determined by how much you earned that payday with the assumption you will make that all year, and if you do and you don't have any other deductions your income tax return should be basically neutral.

Taxes are progressive, meaning that the more you make in a year the higher the percentage of tax you are going to pay.  For example someone who makes $50K in a tax year isn't going to pay half as much tax as someone who makes $100K.  The higher earner pays a higher percentage on their taxes

So in 2021 if you didn't work the whole year and made say $4K for each month and you worked 8 months your yearly income would be $32K.  When they figure out your paycheck they don't know how long you have worked or if you worked somewhere else so they assume you are going to make $4K X 12 and taxes will be withheld as though you were going to make $48K in 2021.  Likewise if you work a bunch of overtime and make $6K in a month they are going to think that you are doing that for 12 months and withhold taxes like you were going to make $72K that year.  I should point out there is no actual thinking going on, there are tables that whoever is figuring out your paycheck has to use.

It's very common for people to think they are getting hosed when they work overtime. ""I don't want to work OT, the gov't is going to take it all"".  That is because if you work a boatload of overtime it assumed when  they figure out your check that you are going to do that all year when in truth you are getting a bunch of it back.

If this is your first full year working as a nurse you are going to hit that happy pay check of the year when you have maxed out your CPP and EI contributions for the year and your paycheck will take a nice unexpected little bump.

This turned into a really long post to explain a pretty simple concept, sorry about that.

Edit: Just figured I should say that it's not your fault you didn't learn this in HS, my kids didn't learn any of it either.  Taxes, interest rates, compounding interest, budgeting, retirement planning (TFSA and RRSP) etc... should all be mandatory.",1651363362

We understand, even in the 21st Century, that often times the choice to take one's life isn't made from a rational state of mind, and is due to a state of crisis / psychosis. Getting an individual out of that moment, and disabling their ability to kill themselves until they can return to a healthy state is important. If you walk into any medical office, and express a desire to harm yourself or others they are legally obligated to report it to an authority that can place you under a 72-hour psychiatric ward. I don't see the Federation being *more* blasé about mental health than the 21st Century United States, and we have no reason to believe they are. We have multiple instances of suicide being stated as *not an option.*
2. The maquis lived in colonies that the Federation was well aware of, and didn't fuck with them until they started killing people / destroying things. The maquis are a petulant faction, and *of course* someone who simps for them would think that Picard's dad locking his mom in the bedroom was a good suicide prevention strategy.",1651363363

Once you've killed the local detection, you just need to avoid server detected things. Movement hacks are easily detected by doing X1 vs X2 minimum threshold comparisons constantly, but you can basically fiddle with lots of other things such as skill cooldowns.

But those are private hacks in small, invite-only communities that cost a significant amount (300$ and upward per year) for a membership and that's why those hacks are not something you just see out and about. The people who afford those are smart enough to not use them in ways that get them detected. The anti-cheat just basically added a couple of months of delay at launch until this started.

"airsoft","t5_2qi2x","Here's my collection of British airsoft weapons, which has been over 10 years in the making so far. 

This collection has seen an extensive amount of work done, and for a few still alot to do. 
There's been real parts fitted where I can, some rifles have been 2 donor weapons mix matched to make one, just so uppers and lowers are correct. 
Lots of custom bits made too like steel barrels where airsoft ones can't be sourced. 
Generally the work list overall is extremely long. 

I've tried my best to get them as right or as close as I can, and give as much attention to detail as possible, even right down to butt/armourer numbers. 
I even made my own accurate QR stickers for the SA80 and susat to match those now currently in use by U.K forces.

All weapons pictured are based on real weapons that have seen or are still in service. 

But out of the whole collection, the jewel in the crown is my L7A2 gpmg. This is a full steel custom build which originated from an Inokatsu M240, but is now a full spec L7. Pretty much the whole weapon has changed. The list is too comprehensive to go through, but every part that needed to change or alter has been. Copious amounts of rs parts fitted to where legal limits allow. So things like gas block, gas plug and flash hider are steel replicas fabricated to look the part. I've even had accurate stamps and marks added to all the right places. 
I then went a bit over the top and ended up collecting an almost entire tripod and SF kit, although still missing the C2 sight. 
Got various sight mounts, slings, all the original A1 parts, blank fire kit, travel boxes and various dated ammo tins. 

I really hope you guys enjoy my builds.
I'm more than happy to answer any question in regards to them, and help anyone doing their own British builds. 

Now to finish up and not bore you anymore, all British service weapons are given a 'L' designation. Now here's a list of the weapons pictured and their retrospective L designations. 

 * L1A2 L66 law (Deepfire)

lolwut?

intel has no free cash flow.  so... no, they couldn't. 

 and you still never explained just HOW this is supposed to hurt amd.  amd already declined the 3nm and they don't seem to really want the expensive leading nodes, anyway.  

amd's been beating intel without the leading node, anyway.  and if intel feels the need to pay out the ass for the leading node in order to compete... while not being properly integrated for it as a business, it's their problem.

if amd really wanted 3nm, i'm pretty sure they would have ordered it.  they've had the spare cash for buybacks and another acquisition...",1651363364

Depression in particular makes hard to be spic n span.

Kiddo had lice once, but in that way they come back three times before they are gone.

The child absolutely couldn't have lice for 6 years. When your child has lice, they don't let them back in school without a lice check. And child wouldn't be sent home for an entire school year without intervention.

"Sockknitting","t5_2gwpq6","My fave sock yarns...

 • 1) opal 4-ply: delightful colours, whimsical names, lovely consistent spin/ply structure, I would knit everything with this yarn if I could

 • 2) Patton's Kroy: a very thick fingering which makes a very warm squishy sock, a relatively discount option, and is available at some big box stores. Yarn structure quality is somewhat inconsistent between colourways but it all knits up ok.

 • 3) regia 4-ply: jury is still out on this one, I've only used half a skein so far. It gets rave reviews from habitual sock knitters, but so far I haven't been wowwed. It's structure is similar to opal but seems to have some variability in thickness.* Overall it's on the thin end of fingering, so the thin sections are a bit worrying, though it still feels strong. I want to try their ""Pairfect"" self-striping colourways with the midpoint marked so you can get two identical socks from the same ball.

*(I've been told this is super out of character for this yarn, so maybe I just got a bad skein).


Wouldn't choose again:

 • drops fabel: spin is quite loose, and it kinks up coming off the skein. It's less expensive, but drop in quality is not worth it for me

 • drops delight: it *is* delightful (soft, and pretty colours), but is loosely spun single-ply so unlikely to make a durable sock. Don't even think about frogging. Would use again for more delicate items though",1651363364

"technology","t5_2qh16","I guess you could look at it that way. Here is another prospective. 

* not many people actually HATE the poor. They just don't consider them. As in ""you don't even cross my mind"". They are non-topics.  This usually results in them getting looked over, screwed, exploited, etc. But generally no one is actively thinking about the underclass. It's kinda a staple of being an underclass. 

 * sometimes government ""help"" causes more harm. Sometimes it's required to get shit done. A bit aspect of politics (or at least what it use to be) was finding that line. Government has done a great job with regards to environmental protection (epa vs no epa). It has done horrible at other things like it's intervention with guaranteed money for college which led to massive tuition inflation and the current student loan crisis of today. 

* all politicians are self interested with an agenda. It's kinda in the job description. The question is if we know his strings. Why not pull them?  He's a man that can be bought. So buy him. Why isn't some green energy company basically saying we will give you $700k a year and a portion of this $ just like you have with coal - but you got to dump that. The corrupt are easy to change.

As for the pfp: Sterling Hayden is a hero for what he did during the 2nd World War. He was later punished for the loyalty and admiration he naturally formed with the people he fought alongside. A truly tragic hero in real life that made his portrayal of Gen. Jack D. Ripper all the more impactful. From his Wiki:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;...his World War II service included sailing with supplies from Italy to Yugoslav partisans and parachuting into fascist Croatia. Hayden, who also participated in the Naples–Foggia campaign and established air crew rescue teams in enemy-occupied territory.  
&gt;  
&gt;He received the Silver Star for gallantry in action in the Balkans and Mediterranean. According to his citation, ""Lt. Hamilton (Sterling's pseudonym while in the service)  displayed great courage in making hazardous sea voyages in enemy-infested waters and reconnaissance through enemy-held areas"", a Bronze Arrowhead device for parachuting behind enemy lines, and a commendation from Yugoslavia's Josip Broz Tito. Tito awarded him the Order of Merit.",1651363365

Icelands bell on the other hand is about how the sagas were preserved. Think those will give you good insight into Icelands history.

So she defaulted to how she understood it… as a straight person who (usually) is attracted by looks. But since Amy’s love of Vicky is defined by the emotions she has tied up in her along with her appearance, the conditioning didn’t stick.

Cherish, by contrast, likely had her power long enough to understand the nuances. Plus she had a skewed sense of morality long before she sought out the Nine, so she probably figured it out faster since she’d have no qualms about blunt forcing her power on an unwilling victim.",1651363365

"MorkBorg","t5_2gbx50","Oh man, so Mork Borg is interesting, because the corebook is more of an artbook/tonepiece with a minimal OSR system added in that your traditional affair. Almost everything you absolutely need to know is in the end pages at the back of the book. Once you have a grasp of that, it should be a little easier to parse through the book and pick up on the rest. Some things are intentionally left vague, especially setting details.

If you're an exclusive 5e player and aren't familiar with the OSR, take a read through the [Principia Apocrypha](https://lithyscaphe.blogspot.com/p/principia-apocrypha.html), which is a primer for understanding the style of play. MB originally targeted the OSR crowd, so there are a lot of assumptions that are made that aren't ever covered directly in the book.

As for adventures, I'd highly recommend just running Rotblack Sludge, which is the adventure included in the corebook. It's explicitly designed to introduce folks to the system. If that doesn't interest you, check out the Cult content on the [Mork Borg website](https://morkborg.com/content/). There are a bunch of free adventures there.

"magicbuilding","t5_30kv1","The one I made, lol. Ok, cheap answer, although true. So here are the ones that are my favorite, other than my own:

* Bending from Avatar The Legend of Aang/Korra has an amazing magic system that is beautifully implemented.
* Alchemy from Full Metal Alchemist is amazing and has a nice scientific approach.
* Nen from Hunter x Hunter is pretty great too.
* Magick from Mage the Ascension and Mage the Awakening TTRPGs have each their own take on reality bending magic with vastly different results but I love them both.
* Hamon and Stands from Jojo is very fun to see, even though Hamon was only used in the first 2 parts (and a tiny bit on the 3rd).
* The stuff from Sandman is fantastic, it's very soft and loose magic system, but it's fascinating and very inspiring.",1651363366

"unpopularopinion","t5_2tk0s","Ok let's hypothetically say you ban phones.
Now security has to divert some of their precious time to regulating the use of phones instead of cracking down on hard drugs and or weapons.

What about people getting their phones mixed up? How about the fact that it will lead many to drive home inebriated instead of calling an uber or a cab.

This isn't a unpopular opinion, it's just a bad idea

Edit: im not implying phones at concerts aren't annoying, but I will say banning them is not the right way to fix it.

A better method to address the issue would be to have a member of staff taking note of those using phones and giving them a media surcharge on the way out the door. This revenue could go to both the club and the artist. Not a flawless solution but certainly more practical then implementing a full ban.",1651363367

"MorbidReality","t5_2tz1e","From Wikipedia: 

Green's thriftiness was legendary. She was said never to turn on the heat or use hot water. She wore one old black dress and undergarments that she changed only after they had been worn out; she did not wash her hands and she rode in an old carriage. She ate mostly pies that cost fifteen cents. One tale claims that Green spent half a night searching her carriage for a lost stamp worth two cents. Another asserts that she instructed her laundress to wash only the dirtiest parts of her dresses (the hems) to save money on soap. She did not want to pay rent for her own office. 

The City of New York came to Green for loans to keep the city afloat on several occasions, most particularly during the Panic of 1907; she wrote a check for $1.1 million and took her payment in short-term revenue bonds. Keenly detail-oriented, she would travel thousands of miles alone—in an era when few women would dare travel unescorted—to collect a debt of a few hundred dollars.

Green's frugality extended to family life. Her son Ned had to suffer a leg amputation, because she delayed so long in looking for a free clinic that his case became incurable. She was wealthy, yet she chose to live like a pauper.

Unsubstantiated rumors claimed that she ate only oatmeal, eggs, and onions, unheated so as not to increase her fuel bill.

Yet she was also a secret philanthropist, avoiding the attention of the press. In her words, ""I believe in discreet charity."" Hetty also had the reputation of being an effective nurse, caring for her young and old neighbors. Her favorite poem was William Henry Channing's ""My Symphony,"" which starts with ""To live content with small means...""

In her old age, Green developed a hernia, but refused to have an operation, preferring to use a stick to press down the swelling. She eventually moved her office to the National Park Bank, when she thought she had been poisoned at the Chemical Bank, a fear she had most of her life.",1651363367

"skyrimmods","t5_2sqqh","The mod looks great and well implemented as others have said. Excellent work that you managed to pull this off

With that being said, I personally think that it would be more interesting if it went a few steps closer to the FromSoft inspiration.

I think that the “text” symbols shown in the world (currently represented by notes) would be better represented by dragon language, like the symbols that the Greybeards threw on the ground when they teach you words. It would add more to the feel I think because the dragon language literally looks similar to FromSoft notes, and it would connect better with the player being a Dovakhiin and having more to “read” in dragon language. They’re also glowy which is more recognizable and distinct than notes out in the world. 

Second, I think it would be cooler to limit the words that can be in notes. The artificial limit that FromSoft games provides to messages, forces players to get creative with the messages which helps define the community culture.

Third, I’d think up some stuff, lore-wise, that justifies Dovahkiins reading messages from each other across different realities. I’m sure that the folks on one of the Elder Scrolls lore subreddits could help out with that. There’s all kinds of stuff with the gods, time, and different planes of existence in the lore. Off the top of my head, I know about a concept called “chim” in the series which is supposedly this higher level of enlightenment where certain characters know that they’re in a game. I don’t think that the mod should have this particular underlying lore tie-in because I’d want the Dragonborn to be unaware that it’s a game, but I mention chim just to show that there’s precedent in the lore for this kind of “extra/cross-universal” understanding. Maybe it could be justified as some kind of Dragon related, practice? Akatosh is a time dragon. The messages could travel through time. Dragons and Dragonborn can read it. 

These are just what I, personally would like to see out of it. It’s up to you. The mod looks great.",1651363367

"LateStageCapitalism","t5_39qgx","Yeah I mean nihilistic edginess is fun but everyone will be in a world of serious pain if the economy is 'allowed to burn'. It needs changes, massive changes, so that it works for the people. There are drastic and revolutionary changes that need to happen. Drastic actions taken, too, to make it happen. But imagining that a phoenix will rise from the ashes of destruction is... a fantasy... I mean, a military junta might, but I doubt that would be any better for the US than the current system...

It makes a big difference as she normally can't do that (in new content), S2 is also better at dealing with crowds than S3, charges faster, and can be used for anti-air.

"antiwork","t5_2y77d","I work in a state with no state income tax - my taxes are all federal level. However when I claim my kid as my dependant on my w-4 at work, as I did my first year, they didn't withhold any federal taxes (only social security and medicare taxes) and it screwed me when I went to file for the year, even with claiming as head of household, child tax credit, and eitc. I only got back about half of what I got back the year before (when I only made about a dollar less an hour incidentally but had all that taken out. New job that year, different withholdings? IDK.) I get paid every two weeks and I know easily the taxes withheld between federal, OASDI, and whatever that third one is (and again, it's not state, my state has no income tax), they pull nearly $200 from each check. Then there's health insurance. And I don't even have my kid on my plan, since I'm the only parent and only earner and I'm low enough, the kid qualifies for Medicaid - but in our state, I don't. After all that comes out, for two weeks and usually running around 82ish hours total, my take-home has been running just under the $1000 mark the last few months or so. Once in a while it nudges above it, but not by all that much, and usually if it does it's because I got stuck staying late on the morning half-day we have every two weeks (if we have a mandatory meeting for example) and bumped my hours closer to the 84 hour mark. That doesn't happen often though. I keep debating about changing my claim status back partway through the year because I'm getting to the point with the rising cost of everything (rent has gone up, food prices and gas prices are rising, the kid is growing out of clothes lately when we didn't used to have this issue) it's almost making more sense to put it back into my paycheck.

Home ownership would be a dream. But there's no way to save for the down payment and my credit score is no where near where it needs to be. And with housing going up and up and up? I pay more in rent than I would a mortgage, I know this, but I'd never get the rate for a lower mortgage, and paying rent, have no way to save the down payment. Even with having every other bill as low as we can go.",1651363369

"utarlington","t5_2sgzg","My experience of breaking away from them was fairly straightforward- I texted both of the guys that were most involved with my ""conversion,"" and told them I had pretty serious doubts about what they believed, and how they went about advertising their faith. There was an initial blowback, where I got multiple paragraphs of texts from them about how I was being led astray and how I wasn't truly saved if I wasn't willing to sacrifice my whole life for their specific brand of faith, which was too be expected tbh. Alan and Hector both took it fairly poorly, but despite seeing them often before and after I left, they weren't particularly interested in conversing with me about the reasons why I left. I doubt they'll do anything to intentionally seek you out and make your life miserable, so you should be all good on that front. 

If anything, the way they responded to my leave of absence revealed a lot about how they think. Various comments and throwaway messages that they sent me before I blocked them really clued me in to their own hubris, not that I can remember any of the texts now off the top of my head. Just think of it as a mediocre breakup: you'll still see them around campus, but you just keep your headphones on and walk straight ahead and you'll be fine.

Best of luck, and if you have any desire to get plugged into good discipleship and faith groups on campus, feel free to reach out!

I agree there is definitely a rise in religious extremism in America (although Christianity itself is declining). These extremist can definitely do a lot of damage. 

What I think you are not taking into account is there are still a huge number of people who wouldn't take what the extremist are trying to do lying down. I think at the moment the extremist are putting up a strong front, but you are already seeing some of the backlash. People will fight it. Hell, even many Christians aren't on board with much of what's going down either. 

Also, when people have such black and white beliefs with no room for compromise, different extremist groups can start to ""cannibalize"" each other over small and petty differences. It's something I've seen weaponized against differing groups like this, albeit on a smaller scale. I doubt some of these groups would be able to continue to work together in the long term.

There is a lot to be worried about and we do need to do everything we can to combat this rising threat from extremists. However, do not get caught up in only fixating on the negative and all the awful. It's how you become hopeless and stop fighting.",1651363370

Looking through them, a large chunk is a show that intentionally has two different versions, but it reminded me that I wanted to split that one. the other 500 or so are mostly episodes that must've duped when I upgraded everything from 720p to 1080p and I must've either forgotten to delete them, or plex didn't play nice when I told it to delete them.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for the advice, I do have everything named and organized properly (as far as Plex cares), it's just that they're split across hard drives, and a single season might have episodes on 3 drives. I do use Tiny MediaManager, and I knew I could've looked into that way, but I was hoping somebody could give me a better method, which you did. Thanks again, you probably just help me free up a few hundred Gb",1651363371

I'm sure that's totally going to work when the fascists are marching down the street.

&gt;And what did Mao and Lenin's work do to stop WW2?

The point of understanding Mao is learning how power works. Notably both are far more effective at preventing fascists from gaining a foothold in a community than trying to play nice with them.
Also, both are a good model for protecting workers from predatory fascists and their allies.

&gt;Mao and Lenin wrote on economics stuff, not the sociology/psychology of extremism.

There is way more to Mao or Lenin than that, which is why reading them is a good idea.

&gt;Funny how the countries without the ""castle doctrine"" has lower violent crime rates.

You have no clue what the castle doctrine is then. This is like claiming ice cream causes homicide.

Then don't imply that gun owners want to murder everyone they see. That's bad faith.",1651363372

"datarecovery","t5_2qpkw","You can plug the SSD onto a PC no problem if it’s healthy.  The PC won’t understand HFS+ and will ask you to format it, but don’t do that.  Open (not scan) it with competent data recovery software that can understand the file system.  DMDE would be a good candidate if you only need one file — it can retrieve up to 4000 files per run from one folder.  If it isn’t basically immediately accessible with that tool, you may have physical damage from the thermal incident or logical damage from charge bleed (where SSDs lose data over time while left unpowered)",1651363372

I learned much about the camera by trying it out myself and watching youtube videos about everything from lens reviews, to camera basics, lighting, camera settings and functions. Now I bought the 85mm 1.2 and this thing is just awesome but wasnt cheap. But I think a very good alternative is also to buy an adapter like u already mentioned and go for sigma lenses. Heard they are also very very good and also not that expensive like the canon rf L lenses.

"Tsukihime","t5_3104d","Obviously read the rest of the Tsukihime routes if you haven't yet, they're all great. (*I'm assuming you're reading the original VN, not the remake, given it's called 'A piece of blue glass moon'*)

I've not read Plus Disc, KT, or Melty Blood yet but since they're the sequels I'd recommend those. Also of note is the Manga adaptation of the Arcueid route and Talk and Prelude.

The four pillar works of the Nasuverse (or five) are Tsukihime, Kara No Kyoukai, Fate Stay Night and Mahoutsukai No Yoru (and Angel Notes).

KnK is slippery. The novels existing fantranslations have a dodgy track record so you're best bet there is probably the Ufotable anime adaptations, which IMO are great but Movie 6 is not a faithful adaptation and Final Record was never adapted. (*If you can read Japanese then don't mind me and just read the LNs*)

Fate Stay Night is great and has an existing fantranslation so no need to rely on adaptations (*Though I personally like the UBW series and HF movie ones*). It's VN is also more technically impressive than the OG Tsukihime due to being newer. It's also the one with the widest breadth of spinoffs/extra works with several sub branches of the verse being Fate specific such as Extra, Grand Order, Apocrypha and whatnot. As well as the direct prequel Fate Zero and works like Case Files (*KnK crossover*) and Strange Fake which are practically set in the same world.

I'll just address Mahoyo briefly, it's a newer VN than FSN or Tsukihime, it follows Aoko Aozaki (*Shiki's mentor from the prologue*). It's only in Japanese but is getting an official English translation in December and an anime adaptation at some point. So I'd definitely recommend looking out for that one since I've heard it's good.

(*Notes is a short story that's been translated so you can read that if you want, it seems to be relevant to Kagetsu Tohya.*)

Given you started with Tsukihime, I'd stick to it's direct spinoffs initially, Kagetsu Tohya, Melty Blood and the like, as they have the characters and settings of Tsukihime in them, before branching out to the other pillar works of the Nasuverse.",1651363374

"reactnative","t5_37k5y","1. By saying “an app we all know”, you’re adding a rather tight business requirement in there… apps we all know are running at a massive scale and have to have existed for a long time. It’s hard to name any RN app we all know as it’s a relatively new technology. There’s a few; obviously Facebook, but also, building an app for millions of users and dozens (or hundreds) of developers is fundamentally different than what the majority of people use these technologies for. 

2. Expo EAS, which is what I suggest if you want all the power of RN, is… 5… or 6 months old. It’s brand new. And it’s a huge shift in what expo can and cannot do. I’ll be writing all my react native apps in Expo EAS moving forward, maybe one of them… one day… will be big enough for “everyone to know”, but for now and the companies I work with, Expo EAS is a great technology that gives our companies a easy way to run iOS, android and Web from one seamless codebase without worrying about the annoyances and nuances of the unique native build systems.

Have you tried Expo EAS? Expo go was limiting, but EAS is fundamentally different and has all the power of React CLI. If you’re hating to just hate, that’s fine, otherwise, what issues have you had with EAS? They are an awesome team and actively work to make their product smooth and seamless for us developers to build awesome and scalable apps!

Arab regime of Algeria abuse its power to repress minorities and unrepresented peoples and is condemned for it by the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization.

Kabyle is not Algeria, Kabyle was always independent until France come and give it to Algeria that is french creation. Now that Algeria got its independence from France, Kabyle is still suffering under Algerian colonization, and the democratic world is with Kabyle for their own liberation.

Flat chests aren't more appealing or beautiful. They just exist, like big chests. Your personal preference is not fact, and I feel as though you stated it as if it's a fact. You are allowed to have opinions, but this straight up feels like body shaming.

Also, this gives me bad vibes. For a number of reasons. First, because it's body shaming. Second, and more importantly, it feels gross, it gives me pedo vibes, similarly to hating body hair on women, considering it is a secondary sex characteristic, and it is a sign that you have physically matured.

"chicagobulls","t5_2s3uz","You’re joking thinking the Grizzlies brand is even close to that of Chicago. The worldwide recognition of the Chicago Bulls equates to real cash money to a player. Zach ain’t going to Memphis but let’s play this game. Ja’s biggest endorsement was with Nike BEFORE he was drafted. Zach signing a max deal with the Bulls nets him 55 million more than he can anywhere else which is in the ballpark of the Nike contract of KD or Kyrie.  But let’s put money aside, why would he move from being the #1 centerpiece of a team to move to be a second fiddle to Ja (whom will get bounced in the next round). This isn’t anywhere close to the KD move to a contender like Golden State.  Now let’s also consider that only Spurs, Pistons, Pacers, Blazers, Magic have enough cap space to sign him (sorry this Chicago front office isn’t taking Russel Westbrook) Zach ain’t going nowhere.",1651363377

Now I try to get as much planning, compare drawings, and get discrepancies figured out ASAP. I don't want to hear that the HVAC guys have seven duct detectors planned when my drawing says we only have one.

I want to say I try to do the same thing, but so far I've been greeted with ""man when I work with such and such he never asked me these types of questions, but you baby me. Just tell me what the next step is."" and ""again dude, I just told you I'm here for the paycheck. Just tell me what to do and I'll do it"". I haven't been training helpers long enough to see them grow into to lead guys, but I can tell you that most helpers quit.

"unpopularopinion","t5_2tk0s","Should an adult talk to the thirteen and fifteen year old about the great sex they had the night before? There aren’t many (and shouldn’t be, I agree with you!) rules for age appropriate discussions with children. Some topics would be fine for one thirteen year old that would be too distressing for another. But I think we can agree that there are some topics and levels of discussion that should be kept adults-only. This is especially true for younger children (with the added aspect of how complaining about government bureaucracy isn’t going to engage them enough to really learn). 

And I’m not saying that your children aren’t gifted. The point of my comment was to bring up how certain kinds of interactions will help a child’s developing brain more than saying “goo goo ga ga” at a baby or speaking down/being dismissive of any conversations with a minor (especially at younger ages, for brain development). 

Maybe your kids are so gifted that they wouldn’t have needed that. My partner certainly didn’t receive a childhood touching healthy or respectful, and he’s the smartest person I know.  But for the kids who aren’t academically inclined, could they have benefitted from this? Could their parents have made learning a little bit easier for them, or a lot, just by doing this?

Then there's the games and catalyst finally getting themselves together. 

There's the explosion of 40K but also GW's handling fans. People realise they enjoy this hobby but want a hobby where they won't regularly be shown contempt and watch the company deliberately ruin their own game to sell more and Battletech is one of the most recognised names. Everyone recognises the madcat. Other wargames and mini games companies are probably really enjoying the last year in GWland right now. 

TTS and the fanaminations hurt more long term, but there was a lot of noise from non customers over that. People who actually buy minis got disillusioned when GW made an a balance update people had to pay for that made the game worse and then unleashed armies that were imbalanced by design. The faction agnosticism of Battletech is lovely and while BV may be imperfect, it's applied even handedly and not arbitrarily.",1651363378

Muscles are supposed to be soft regardless of their size when relaxed; if they’re not, that might indicate tightness or swelling. Healthy tissues in general are supposed to be soft and pliable, but they can tighten up due to injury and stuff.

By the way, though your goals may be different than mine, my advice would be to maybe focus more on measurable performance than on perceived muscle attributes, as it’s more objective, easier to see progress, and strength is in big part neurological (nervous system adaptations as opposed to musculoskeletal ones, so not visible), anyway.

Good luck.",1651363379

Don't know who invented it or implemented it first but I know Rover started using them on 4x4s back in the late 40's on the original Land Rover Series I. Essentially it has a CV axle that the CV sits in grease or oil. As long as you make sure to maintain the seal especially that seal at the ball it gives the CV and the bearings incredible lifespan.  Also used by Toyota, 60's era American domestic brands and Mercedes.  Pretty sure this is Toyota axle which is really a simplified copy of the land rover design. The two designs were such kissing cousins in design, dimensions and strength that when Toyota  beefed up the CVs for the factory lockers available on J80 series there was a essentially a bolt on kit developed that adapted the Yota 3rd member and CV axles to the Rover housing. It even kept the full floated nature of the Rover axle which had been removed when Toyota simplified their design so this kit became a cheap alternative to aftermarket HD CVs/Axles for alot of Rover guys.",1651363379

Yeah at first it seems like a slow pace where not much is accomplished but what's the alternative? You exhaust yourself trying to force your brain to do a few hours of nonstop work?

"forgeofempires","t5_2tj0e","Assume all maps are scouted in advanced, have enough fps and goods,  you are active, log on multiple time to send out the ships, mine the ores, etc, based on my experience:

AF: about 3-4 weeks.

OF: at least 8 weeks, but 10 weeks is more realistic. 

VF: can breeze through immediately if you gather enough prom and orich back in AF and OF, if not, about 2-3 weeks.

From SAM and beyond, any age can be camped, they are all good. I like SAAB the best. To gather enough special goods in each age, plus some extra for the next few ages, one months in each age is more than enough. Mining is much faster than those ships in AF and OF. 

Now with the new AI Core, I think you can speed up AF and OF by a bit. It is expensive to level though, and how useful is it afterwards, I’m not sure. If you plan ahead properly from AF to all the space ages, you don’t really need the special ability of the AI Core. At that time, its sole purpose will be for guild treasury, but most big and active guilds have plenty of goods in the treasury from VF and beyond. No AI Core for me!",1651363379

"ffxiv","t5_2rgs7","I generally think FF's story telling trope of ""humanising the evil empire later"" comes back to bite it in the ass when so much of the repeatable content and key story moments are about joyfully slaughtering those bad guys. Yeah yeah sure it's some ""Bigger bad's"" fault and then they get humanised and the buck keeps getting passed on to some truly irredemable superior, but the blood of many soldiers is still on our hands. The fact these games make you a living WMD obviously capable of killing so many people always makes me a little uncomfortable in the first place.

If I had to point to something specific, I wish we could have come up with a plan for the Eulmoreans in Lakeland other than ""surprise chemical warfare then we rush in and slaughter any still standing while they're still terrified."" That's some dark-chapter of history tier stuff. It especially comes off as off to me given that the Eulmoreans play the role of ""evil empire"" for only a single expac and their arc has to be accelerated, largely by making their dependance on and ignorance of their evil dictactor so crystal clear cut and then their giddy humanisation and redemption and loving acceptance of us comes quite soon after we've killed so many of them. That and the fact that there's a whole subplot going on about how horrible Varis is for wanting to resort to a chemical weapon.

I also straight up despise the pixies and all that lives in Il Mheg for their sadistic ""combat techniques"" of transforming every outsider they see into abominations to maintain their ethnostate. This creepily is supposed to come across as endearing and cute because every man woman and child who goes to Il Mheg has it coming? Well sorry I don't have the morals of a Brothers' Grimm tale. I suppose the blood (or rather, 'lifelong torment') is not on our hands directly at least, but if this were a game you could do anything I would leave those creepy bastards in the dust, tell Feo Ul to get bent, and work with the Crystarium on a campaign to bring those freaks to heel before I head out.

At that stage of a relationship, I’d expect you not to even use the term “dating,” although some people do still say they’re dating even if they’re exclusive, which I always found odd, personally.

The best answer anyone can give you is to just talk to him. If you’ve been together for over a year, this is something you should feel comfortable discussing. Ask him what he meant and tell him how it made you feel. It’s very possible he didn’t even think twice about the phrasing he used and does consider you to be exclusive.

"ValorantCompetitive","t5_2g5ach","Sinatraa was average mechanically in overwatch, below average even. So was babybay.

I never said overwatch players are the best players in this game, I just said they're mechanically better on average. Cs players are better overall I said because aim doesn't matter much in valorant. I was never flaming cs or val players for having bad aim I was just pointing out that it's not necessary for them to have good aim so many will be worse mechanically than overwatch players. Doesn't make them a worse player though because it's mostly crosshair placement and then microadjustments instead of tracking or crazy flicks.

How's it a bad take to say that pros in x game that needs y skill are better at y skill than pros who don't need it in their game to be top tier. That's like arguing that a soccer player could become a top tier basketballer. 

I'm pretty much saying overwatch players are better than soccer players at hitting 3 pointers but saying it doesn't matter that much because they're not playing basketball. Hardly a bold take.",1651363381

#### [*1984* (George Orwell, 1948)](https://archive.org/details/1984GeorgeOrwell_201606/page/n1/mode/2up)

Kevin would like to say that this book is truly inspirational, and that he would give it a 10/10


#### [*How to Be a God: A Guide for Would-Be Deities* (Richard Bartle, 2022)](https://mud.co.uk/richard/How%20to%20Be%20a%20God.pdf)

Kevin would like to mention that this book is one of the greatest sources of existential terror he has read (and it contains a lot of interesting content regarding game design as well), and he would give it a 10/10


#### [*Almost Pounded By The Physical Manifestation of Simulation Theory After Realizing We're Erotica Characters Then Deciding To Just Be Friends* (Chuck Tingle)](https://www.chucktingle.com/uploads/5/3/7/3/53730093/almost_pounded_by_the_physical_manifestation_of_simulation_theory_after_realizing_we%E2%80%99re_erotica_characters_then_deciding_to_just_be_friends.pdf)

Kevin would like to say that this book was surprisingly wholesome, and is a great book for helping one to feel more at-ease with the universe, so he would give it 10/10

####[*Ulysses* (James Joyce, 1922)](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Ulysses_(1922))

Kevin mentioned that he wasn't entirely sure what he just read. However, it's still not bri*ish, and was still rather interesting, so he would give it a 10/10

####[*The Assassination Of John Fitzgerald Kennedy Considered As A Downhill Motor Race* (J. G. Ballard, 1967)](https://web.archive.org/web/20220121203810/https://evergreenreview.com/read/the-assassination-of-john-fitzgerald-kennedy-considered-as-a-downhill-motor-race/)

Kevin told me that this was an interesting interpretation of the JFK assassination, and of the post-WW2 media landscape in the USA in general, so he would give it a 10/10.

Source?

A source. I need a source.

Sorry, I mean I need a source that explicitly states your argument. This is just tangential to the discussion.

No, you can't make inferences and observations from the sources you've gathered. Any additional comments from you MUST be a subset of the information from the sources you've gathered.

You can't make normative statements from empirical evidence.

Do you have a degree in that field?

A college degree? In that field?

Then your arguments are invalid.

No, it doesn't matter how close those data points are correlated. Correlation does not equal causation.

Correlation does not equal causation.

CORRELATION. DOES. NOT. EQUAL. CAUSATION.

You still haven't provided me a valid source yet.

Nope, still haven't.

"redskygames","t5_5gz0it","It depends on the ship and national line. I don't really know how to answer this question. Both if you want a shorter answer.

There's no way to answer that easily. I think ships like Dreadnaught are too important to just be premium ships. Kongo, perhaps some of her sisters, Missouri should be open to all players. They're extremely important to history through to have some extremely long service lives. Shigure from the IJN, being an extremely lucky ship surviving many battles. Assuming I remember the particular destroyer correctly.

Ships like HMS Hood, Bismarck, Tirpitz, Scharnhost, all seem to be important and good ships for a tech tree choice as well. On the other hand, being so famous, skins or premium ships of those, also sound like good ideas. HMS Incomparable, that could be an interesting premium, as its a bit of a divergent chain of development, possibility.

There's a lot of options out there and then there's even more than that when you start looking at them.

&amp;#x200B;

Right now I'm finalising core mechanics and prepping documents for getting investors on board with this. Practical paths to development that they can take to the bank to pay me to get this done. Just doing the Royal Navy, Commonwealth battleship line in the Dreadnaught era has been extremely difficult.

There's a plan to shape development towards creating a fuller national line up, even trying to offer a complete Royal Navy tech tree for you guys to see how I want to have this built and run. That is going to be a lot of research and a lot of work, checking dates and working out just where to place them. What my guidelines are. Do I preference launch date over design date? Do I have Rodney, another historically noted ship for its part in the sinking of Bismarck as a premium or does it fit into the Royal Navy line up? Does the R class and refits of take up tech tree space instead?

That I could do with some time to chew through and some thoughts from you guys on. Especially if I also start thinking about what should be a reward ship, an entire third category of ship to consider here.  


Don't mind the edit here, but I forgot to mention that the store also offers you the ability to make your own premium ship. If you buy the premium token and apply it to a ship, it gains the Premium reward booster. So if you want a premium of a ship and it's not one I've, we've set as a premium, you can make it one yourself.",1651363382

The people who say it the most are paid to, and ironically often say such things on the very platforms they claim are censoring them. So they mostly know it's horseshit. Hell, Twitter, based on their TOS, would technically have been justified to ban most of the Republican Party based on their tweets, but didn't because they didn't want to ban high-profile users. I've personally seen right-wing nobodies/trolls get away with violating Facebook's TOS multiple times.

""I'd gladly let my husband cum inside me but his baby making juice is just so tasty. I could drink it all day long!""

BTW, I work in radio, and one time when I worked for a Sirius XM show (one where we could get away with this kind of talk), I shared many of these and more for everyone listening. I'm convinced someone in my family heard the show that day, because before the show my husband and I got asked about kids constantly. After that day, we NEVER got asked again.

But if you’re treating each other like friends AND having sex (and are attracted to each other) you start blurring the boundaries pretty quick. It is easy for me to start having expectations even when I didn’t want a relationship in the first place! So even if no one “catches feelings” it’s easy for things to escalate or get unbalanced. That being said, I had a great time at the time and would be open to doing it again. But I would have to be very attracted to the person physically while also knowing there’s something about them or is that takes a relationship off the table- perfect storm. I also think men have a tendency to forget in FWB or open relationships that communication and respect become even more important!!! I definitely wouldn’t be interested in a straight up booty call or regular sex with someone who can’t give me the time of day otherwise.",1651363385

Either way, I still see Mehujael as easily the best one. Unlike Naamah, he puts his own life on the line saving his crew members and other citizens. Under his rule, the Nibiru Deep Mines developed into a supportive and healthy community. Even when it all came crashing down, he sacrificed himself so that they could live, which is pretty much the opposite of what I assume Naamah did.",1651363386

All of the undergrads I have worked with have taken their jobs seriously and aim to do well. Most are science, pre-med, or public health majors. 

Many students don’t have Mom and Dad supporting them. You need to re-evaluate your attitude about this from the students perspective. What work experience are they gaining if working for free? Only very mature and financially well off students might deliver what you are looking for. Tbh I would just ask the one competent student back and not the rest. Start fresh with a new batch and if you can’t pay them, really work on building a relationship with them, jingle an excellent letter of recommendation as an incentive, give a definite time period for their volunteer service, make your lab procedures crystal clear with and visually posted, emphasis the positive impact they are having on the field. But don’t complain about free labor.

Traditional baby showers are usually ladies only; but coed showers are becoming more common. I prefer these are there are fewer games and less pregnancy stories; but some people prefer a female only event where they feel more free to share personal details; it’s really up to you.

I would be in the bathroom scrubbing my arm and almost crying if someone sprayed some of these perfumes on me (from the other comments) because I have the unfortunate ability to smell synthetic  ingredients and fixatives that are subtle or even invisible to most people, but they smell overpowering and horrifying to me.  If you don't want to disappoint sensitive people like me, I'd be absolutely thrilled with a natural perfume that avoids synthetic ingredients or fixatives, like Aftelier or April Aromatics or Hilde Soliani, even if it's a lot smaller than what you're picturing.

Gourmand perfumes open up the possibility of matching something on the wedding menu and that's totally what I would do if I was my idea. La Via Del Profumo Amber Chocolate for example - smells like those chocolates with a cherry/alcohol center. Chabaud Lait de Bisquit smells like Hershey's kisses.  Hilde Soliani has several good coffee scents and one that smells like green apples. I'd be tempted to find a gourmand perfume that I love, build a menu dish around it, and then your ""I hope you remember our special day"" message takes on even more meaning.

If you don't want to disappoint the other end of the bell curve (the ones whose senses are a lot more dull than average) then my idea is terrible because they might not be able to even smell it without synthetic ingredients to make it project 🙂",1651363390

But for me her taking this long is actually a positive for Arsenal. If you look at some of the clubs she’s linked with there is no doubting they are in a better place than we are. So I would assume her taking her time is down to (and maybe this is misguided hope) a reluctance to leave and possibly her approving of the progress we are making (on and off the pitch), whether that progress is enough for her is obviously the sticking point. 

I will also say if her contract expires and she’s still undecided I don’t think we take our offer off the table. So she has all the time on the world and frankly good for her because so many players careers are messed up from bad moves. I already think it’s a good tell of her character that she isn’t swayed by the money offered, but by the project.",1651363391

My guy, this is like saying 'America or the confederacy didnt own slaves' because the contracts were owned by companies and individuals. Slavery was legal and practiced in French and Spanish colonies with the blessings of the home country. Cuba and Haiti were parts of their respective countries for example, just like British colonies were part of Britain.

All that said, you do live under your mother's authority, in her house, so there is a lot to be said for following the rules of your household.

With vaccinations but no masking, in an indoor event, I don't know what to expect. That's better than doom and gloom ""gencon will be a superspreader"" but it's complicating what is already a very complicated decision.

Simply put, it's easier for people to decide on whether to go based on their comfort levels and local/national covid rates if they know gencon's policy follows the safest plan and isn't subject to change (aka adding another variable to watch out for).",1651363391

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","When I was a kid my mom said she was taking me to the doctor to get a physical. Nobody told me what a physical entailed. 

So when the doctor reached into my pants to grab my testicles it was a massive shock. 

I remember feeling gross and uncomfortable in my own skin for some time after. 

Kinda seems like common sense professionalism to explain to somebody that your about do something like that and why. 

Same doctor, but I'm an adult now, I went to her to discuss a change in my symptoms regarding my anxiety. Her immediate response was ""well I dont know, we've already tried other medications."" 

To me it just seemed like she was telling me she didnt want to have to do anything. Which is frustrating because it's not uncommon for medication to become less effective over time requiring an adjustment to the treatment. 

I thought I was doing the responsible thing by coming to her and telling her my symptoms had changed and what I got was a doctor seemingly frustrated she still had to deal with this problem.",1651363391

Why not take a look at the comments of those that yearn for Blomkamp's vision: pensioners Ripley and Hicks, soldiers, a queen, the derelict, and ripley donning a xeno suit (neo power loader) to do battle. The fact that people actually *want* that kind of fanfiction trash to overwrite Alien 3 says it all. 🤣 Alien Covenant is no masterpiece, and it doesn't come close to the original trilogy by a long shot. But I'm eternally grateful for what we got over Blomkamp's rubbish, and it doesn't deserve the hate it gets. There are people in this subreddit who actually consider Alien Resurrection to be superior - which speaks volumes. What we *really* need more than either is something with the love and care that was put into Alien Isolation - the aesthetics, the horror, the tension, a single xeno being a threat, and not simple bug-like canon fodder that anyone with an automatic weapon can mow down.

I'm hopeful that Fede Alverez will do the series justice, I was worried when he handled the reboot of 'The Evil Dead' and it turned out to be a strong addition to the original movie - hopefully he will recapture the magic of 'Alien' in a new and unique way.",1651363393

"pokemonanime","t5_2vir1","&gt;Them changing a flashback is them directly changing parts of the story

That is an assumption with no basis in fact. We saw a flashback of Ash reminiscing about the companions he traveled with in Kalos in JN103, but Serena wasn't present. Does that mean that the staff directly changed part of the story to retcon that Serena never traveled with Ash in Kalos? No. Obviously that would be absurd. Of course Serena traveled with Ash in Kalos, whether they showed it in the flashback or not.

Think about it; the assumption you're making here is wild and illogical. Again, in-universe wise it is simply a continuity error and nothing more.  


&gt;The scene only says about Ash and Greninja being like each other. It has nothing to do with the form Ash-Greninja

I don't like having to repeat myself about basic facts. In that scene Ash is describing the Bond Phenomenon. He is describing it in the same terms he described it back in XY. I know you know he explained the Bond Phenomenon in those terms back in the XY series.

A-G is rooted in the Bond Phenomenon. Thus that scene most certainly has something to do with A-G.",1651363394

"TPB","t5_2qxe5","Windows disables the file type in the file name by default. This means that the file 'image.png' will display as 'image'  
A super basic exploit that has existed ever since windows started doing this is to rename a malicious file from 'malware.exe' to 'image.png.exe' or even just 'image.exe'. This means that default users will see the file name and double-click it, unknowningly running the software when they thought it was going to open an image for them to view using whatever image viewer their operating system recognizes images should normally be displayed with.  
This means the program will be executed and whatever was in 'image.png.exe' will be run.   
To make things worse whoever made the program can also change the icon of the file to something custom. This is great for things like your web browser so you can visually see what file does what at a glance without reading the file name every time. Unfortunately it also means that 'image.png.exe' can have a custom icon that looks like the default PNG icon.

There is a trend online of Millennials reminiscing about the 90s as the ""perfect time"". Though there are some interesting arguments regarding economic growth and political stability, a lot of the time its fairly rose-colored nostalgia of the innocence of childhood.  Life was good because they were children and didn't have to engage with the issues of the day (though you could comment that without widespread internet it was harder to be *aware* of the issues of the day).   I quite like [this article](https://prospect.org/power/false-glow-remembered-childhood/) that discusses it.Though other generations do it too (see the idea of a boomer going ""back in my day...."") I think what puts millennials apart is they are one of the first really tech savvy generations so are more willing to put that sort of idea out into the world.

"nrl","t5_2qn90","Storm star Brandon Smith is reportedly being investigated by the NRL after he allegedly made an unprofessional comment during an interview.

Nine's Danny Weidler revealed in The Sydney Morning Herald on Sunday that the NRL is in the process of deciding whether to issue Smith with a breach notice.

Weidler claims that Smith, who he says has now been warned by future club the Roosters that he will become a media target in Sydney, was heard allegedly using a Pidgin English term.

astonishing success

The comment that was allegedly made occurred when Smith interrupted a Storm interview with Papua New Guinea teammate and Storm winger Xavier Coates, according to Weidler's report.

While the word Smith used didn't appear to phase Coates at the time, it does have several meanings of a sexual nature, which has rattled PNG supporters, the SMH report claims.

The 25-year-old last year was fined and suspended last year alongside teammates Cameron Munster and Chris Lewis after a video emerged of the three players in a hotel room with a white substance on the table.

Smith will join the Roosters in 2023 after he signed a three-year deal with the club in December.",1651363397

Now my current therapist I always feel better after talking with her, and while at times I do not want to follow her advice but I do not feel the pressure to do so - I can choose what to follow, and sometimes after a while I find myself circling back to something she recommended and following it when I am ready for it.

It's all a balance

So if you are operating more in your masculine

You're off balance

If I had to guess it accounts for 30-odd percent of all host deaths in that fight. 40 percent is the Waterfowl, which I can understand because its dodging method isn't obvious. 10 percent is any attack where she stabs at you from the air or across the room, another 10 percent is her one attack where she swipes her prosthetic sword back and forth (the one where it sparks), and the final 10 percent is mostly just random misfortune.",1651363398

"zen","t5_2qhmf","1. You may understand that the phrase ""feel about him"" is a euphemism but many people do not.
 * I don't have any particularly strong feelings for Alan Watts
 * When I point out he wasn't very well educated and that he was a sex predator I'm not doing it to dis him, I'm just talking about the facts.

2. I've spoken out in favor of the way of Zen a couple of times and I do think it's a good book for people who are trying to cure themselves of 60's Japanese Buddhism.
  * The problem that Mr Watts has and transfers to the people who follow him is that he doesn't ake much academic progress even though he was intellectually capable.
 * The combination of his religious upbringing and his alcohol addiction proved to be more than his curiosity could tolerate.  So a person who could have kept thinking and advancing the conversation ended up spending his short life accomplishing less than you or I could in a few years... In terms of following conclusions to new conclusions.

3.  I can't emphasize this enough but comparatively honest in the '60s isn't that honest.  Lots of people come to this forum specifically because they want to talk about how much they like the thinking done in the 50s 60s and 70s and it turns out that for the most part it very very little thinking was done.  It's not a coincidence that we [look at these dates](www.reddit.com/r/zen/wiki/fraudulent_texts) and see a pattern a half century later.

"3d6","t5_2wkux","I don't know much about trailer park boys, but the go-to ""wrestler"" build is a Rogue-Barbarian multiclass. One level in Rogue gets you expertise in Athletics, and Barbarian rage gives you advantage on your checks, so your grappling is going to be amazing. The two classes also tend to combine well since Reckless Attack gives you advantage for Sneak Attack, which works as long as you're using a Finesse weapon, even if the attack uses your Strength, so while wielding a Rapier you're benefiting from every class feature.

For level order there's a serious argument to go Barbarian to 5 and then grab the Rogue level. The double PB to athletics matters more later, and having Extra Attack as early as possible is crucial. That said starting Rogue gets you more skills, and you're essentially fully online at level 3, so if flavour from the start is more important than having a really rough level 5 that's a way to go. You could also focus on leveling Rogue after level 6 in either order for more damage if you don't find the further Barbarian stuff appealing.

Battle Masters also get good options for grappling/tripping people, could just build one of those.",1651363398

"nursing","t5_2ra72","been there done that. grappling with or denying (fighting) a problem actually reinforces its existence in your mind. the only way to ""move past"" these maddening thoughts/images is to look straight at them without fear, then step back and give it to that Higher peaceful power within you, the truth about you. you hold out this pain and ask that your Higher power will receive it from you. I know, this seems ridiculous on its face. ""nothing can help with my problems"", we say to ourselves. but just try it for awhile. it is so simple that it's hard to believe this could actually help us, but it does!

often we are mostly attuned to what gives us pain and fail to recognize the thought processes which correct erroneous thinking. we are proficient at designing hellscapes galore, creating a crazy mess of our life and then send it all to a dark place. right? well, reverse that thinking! this is an actual form of mind-training I've found and been practicing for awhile now. it works. all you need is the willingness to shift your perception, along with watching your judgmental thoughts about yourself and all others. in other words, walk softly in this gentle peace you now create for yourself and others.

I didn't say that all the problems that normally come to you will stop. you're still in the world so you will encounter worldly problems. what is important to remember is your capacity to choose again another way of seeing all that comes up. it's the being vigilant to what brings you pain, seeing it and being willing to shift your perception with the help of knowing you are really the peaceful place inside you. this allows you to keep your peaceful center.

don't be afraid to sit for a moment with eyes closed, quiet your mind (let go of all the crazy stuff) and go silently within to visit the peace that resides within you. go in with an open mind and an open heart. nothing more is needed. we can’t wait for outside circumstances to change for us to be at peace, we need to make the internal shift that will heal our lives. we cannot change all that we see as wrong in the world, but we can change our internal climate from chaos to peacefulness. it only takes a moment to touch your peace, then rejoin the world recharged again. after some practice this becomes deeply internalized, an automatic response. we carry it with us.

what thoughts arise to you in the midst of surrounding chaos? are you shaken by the world you witness or do you remain strong in your peace? you'll begin to realize your strength in the goodwill you carry, how it helps to calm the churning waters others want to escape from but haven't learned how. we choose again for peace. we work at the level of the solution. protect this wondrous design by humbly holding it deep within your heart and mind.",1651363400

We're called No Stupid Questions because we believe nobody needs to be attacked for asking a question, but *that doesn't mean there are no rules!* This sub is meant for users like you to ask genuine questions. Please don't ask jokes or rants disguised as questions - that's not in the spirit of this sub. While you *can* ask almost anything here, please keep illegal and offensive questions elsewhere to give people a good experience here - and if you have a medical question, please ask your doctor, not us.

Are there people that I think wouldn't be interested in the series? Absolutely. That's not a bad thing. It's a matter of taste. There are plenty of shows, even very popular ones, that I have no interest in watching, but I won't go out of my way to bash on them just because I refuse to take the time to understand what it is that makes people enjoy them.

What are you defining as true worship?

&gt;Matthew 18:18-19 tells us that at least the apostles had such authority. There's a few other places too, like being able to raise the dead like St. Peter did. If one has authority given by the Holy Spirit, then it's been given to them. Any authority comes from God.

God gives them authority to do what He already declared or made His mind on. He does not give authority to sinful man to make new Laws, declare as holy, etc. They are making decisions on various matters/situations that are in accord with God's mind, which will also be in accord with the written Word.

1. Is to stay away. They are online friends you can make up any excuse. While lying to your friends is usually a bad thing, this would definitely be an exception.

2. Is to rationalize it in your head that an actual relationship with her wouldn't be healthy for either of you and that the crush and feelings for her are fun and make you feel good when you're with her and that that is the best possible relationship you can have. Rather than focus on missing her focus on looking forward to spending time with her.

Look most people can't do #2, but that's the relationship me and my best friend had for most of our 20s. We flirted, we kissed and we even fucked a couple of times. The entire time we were in love with each other. But we both knew that us in an actual relationship would end up horribly. Now we're just friends, both of our feelings have passed. 

Also if you ever need someone to talk to outside of your online friends feel free to DM me. I've had lots of online friends over the years and I met my bf playing league of legends lmao. I even had a crush on an online friend, while introducing her to her boyfriend and then she abandoned our friendship to spend all her time with him.",1651363404

You literally are making arguments on both sides of the argument, and now when I'm pointing out that your two opinions don't jive, you're calling me names... this is the cognitive dissonance I was talking about, it was just giving me a headache, but I'm glad you've noticed it too.  


That frustration and anger you're feeling, that's you realizing that your own opinions literally don't make sense. You calling me an idiot, is called projection, that's when you put your own feelings with yourself (being angry for being stupid enough to think 2 contradictory opinions) onto another person.

Those stories about INNOCENT people getting banned is BS too. It is like when I was a kid I stole from my local drug store about 30 times (a packet of certs or snickers), then I was there with another kid who stole something and I didn't steal anything that day, but they blamed both of us and I got ground for a whole summer. I was upset that I got in trouble but didn't actually do anything wrong THAT DAY but realized stealing is WRONG and never did it again. These dudes that get banned have all been cheating for years before they finally get caught, and as your OP says SO MANY GET AWAY with it.

As far a crime goes, I do agree the idea of you let 9 guilty people go free rather than have 1 innocent person go to jail. But on ESO the cheating is so rampant I think I'd rather have those 9 guilty and one innocent person get banned rather than no one at all. Or like I said the best solution I think is allow the 'blocking' function to work for any interaction, because cheating that doesn't affect me isn't really my issue, but people cheating against me or just people I don't want to interact with should be in my control to stop.",1651363406

"StructuralEngineering","t5_2ttcu","This question is not quite as easy as it might seem.  Some engineering judgment is required.

Say, for example, that you have a typical residential basement wall with a footing that is only 18 inches wide.  The ability of the footing to restrain rotation and behave as a ""fixed"" support is limited due to the dimensions of the footing and the geotechnical properties of the subgrade.  Therefore, residential basement walls are typically designed as simply-supported members (Ref. ACI 332).

However, if the footing is several feet wide due to heavy gravity loads or other reasons, then the resistance to rotation will be substantial and it would be unconservative to idealize it as simply-supported.  It still may not be a truly fixed connection, but there will be significant moment developed at the base.  It is difficult to quantify the amount of rotation, so a practical method would be to envelope the solution by designing the mid-height of the wall assuming simple supports but designing the base of the wall assuming a fixed base.",1651363406

Also, I’ve often suspected that he and others actors from his generation just from talking to one another may may have heard stories similar to Shelly’s and developed a sort of “fuck that” attitude when it came to directors like Kubrick.

"Wizard101","t5_2su2m","Making the blades do equal damage kinda does help with the school uniqueness, at least when paired with the actual damage of the spells of the school.   


Honestly, if anything, Ice should have the absolute lowest blade percentage of either 25% or 30%, and Storm should have the blade that gives +40% because its 'in line' with the school being able to deal the highest amount of damage over all, thus the blade being more potent compared to other schools makes sense theming wise.   


You also have to remember that even if multiple schools have the same 'gear damage', that doesn't mean they're actually doing the same amount of damage, or that they're nearly as effective as one another. Lets look at colossus and triton for example.   


If a storm wizard has just 90% damage on gear, then their triton will, without any blades, aura or boosts/resists from enemies, will, deal 1510-1662 damage  


In order to get colossus to deal that same amount of damage without blades, aura, or boosts, an ice wizard would need to dedicate themselves to getting 180% damage on gear, and even then the low end of the spell still is weaker than triton by almost 60 points (1442-1666 as the damage for a colossus boosted by 180% damage).   


The uniqueness for the schools comes from the individual spells themselves, and how well gear pieces can be used to accentuate. Naturally, a storm wizard is going to get a lot more out of damage than an ice wizard would, and a life wizard makes more out of outgoing healing, or an ice wizard makes more out of resist (because of their higher health, a higher resist further increases their 'maximum effective health' more efficiently than that of lower health schools)",1651363407

Penn tends to be heavier and definitely not as smooth as Shimanos, but higher drag, and much better line capacity, and are just workhorse reels, so I use them where smoothness isn’t important, and where drag is needed.

"Superstonk","t5_43zwn1","A few thoughts.

1.   Housing prices happen at the edge of the market.   That means that a few fire sales set the prices for the market.   The psychology that unfolds is that the potential saviors of the housing market sit on the sidelines waiting for the better deal.   They try to time the dip.   This makes things worse.   Only 5% of the housing market being dumped can dump the market.  
2. We have a new player in town called Basel III.   If a big bank fails now - the negatives on its balance sheet in the form of debt (bonds) is wiped out.   The former debt holders become the new shareholders and the original shareholders are (partially or fully) wiped out.   The idea was to put the risk on the shareholders who 'own' the company.   But this is where market linkages get weird.   Who owns those bonds?   Goldman sold $12B of bonds this year but we don't know to who?   Other banks?   How the hell will that be helpful?   Unintentional system risk could come from the Basel III Bail-In Regime.   Go google that for fun.
3. RBC.   There were rumors in Toronto that a dry-run of the RBC absorption had happened and that the new suitors were even identified (TD and BMO).   Those rumors emerged around the time that RBC stated publicly that their Chinese Bonds were only a small portion of their balance sheet.   
4. Canada mortgages.   It's long been believed that Canadians can't walk away from mortgages if the underlying asset collapses in value.  Not so.   If you declare bankruptcy (say your house is 200,000 underwater) then the 'underwater portion' is fully discharged under the bankruptcy.  You walk away from the house of course - but also the debt.     It's a bit more complicated than that - but Canadian mortgages are not as 'full recourse' as some would believe.
5. And don't forget the follow-on impact to real-world employment.    How many mortgage processors, bankers, real estate agents, yacht brokers, wait staff, retail clerks, manufacturing employees will lose their jobs in the contraction?   That exacerbates the problems above.
6. And finally, much has been made of the fact that the Fed's tools have been exhausted.   Welcome to Stagflation.   The solution - a period of prolonged high interest rates, increased tax rates combined with reducing the monetary base and government belt tightening.    The reset will probably take 3-10 years.   

The sad part is that if the fed has used a helicopter to deliver the cash to average people (rather than the banks) then standards of living would have gone up, income equality would have improved, asset inflation would still be happening as would inflation - but interest rates would have also gone up, giving the Fed its usual tools to address it.

Progressive taxation could have kept the budgets balanced too.   With so much cash swirling around in the real economy - governments can stick their fingers in and grab what they need.   It's a paradox but well established.

"dndnext","t5_2vbgl","Thank you, I didn't realize REF5 laid it out in that level of detail. I've mostly gone off of later works. A number of which go with the ""this isn't for players"" concept. Much like they did with other forms of undead.

As for Van Richten's Guide to the Lich, that one is far less detailed than REF5. It focuses on the Phylactery, and then mentions that the potion involving many poisons both natural an d magical as  well as the heart of a sentient being are mixed with a laundry list of spells. Though the book is pretty clear that this is a MONSTER concept not a PC option. 

Ditto with Dragon #26. Though to repeat my earlier point, it's clear this isn't meant for players to do as the ingredients include ""the blood of a dead humanoid infant killed by a phase spider"" and ""the blood of a dead humanoid infant killed by a mixture of arsenic and belladonna"" and ""the heart of a virgin humanoid killed by wyvern venom"".",1651363408

"boxoffice","t5_2r1ky","The DoD has a policy where they only cooperate with productions that portray the military favorably and aid recruiting efforts and they have to approve any movie scripts that involve the armed forces if they want access to real equipment and for them to provide technical advisors. They also ask for (and usually receive) script changes too - the love interest's job in the first one was changed because those kind of relationships aren't allowed between colleagues at that point, for instance. On a bigger note, one of the making of documentaries also revealed that the technical advisor from the military also requested that they change Goose's death from one caused by two F-14s colliding to what we got in the movie and it was changed.

I mean come on, the entire movie is fighter pilots being awesome and they were given access to real military equipment and locations, do you think they do that for anything that doesn't act at least a little bit as propaganda?

"TooAfraidToAsk","t5_2ssp7","Indian-American here; my parents immigrated from Kolkata to California.

When I was young, I went to Kolkata for my cousin's wedding. Obviously, we took some photos and when I got back to America, I wanted to share them with my classmates.

My outfit in the weddings was apparently inappropriate. It was a sari, and the same thing all the other women were wearing. But because saris are so often sexualized in Western culture, ""sari = sexy"" is embedded in many Western cultures.

Now, I don't wear a bindi - I'm an Atheist and don't feel right wearing one. I know my mother might prefer to...but can't. Because here, many women wear bindis as a fashion statement; therefore, at work, it's considered inappropriate, because it's seen as a fashion choice, not a cultural or religious choice. Things are better now - and my mother is agnostic enough to not care either way - but this was something that caused us some sadness in the past. For more devout families, it could cause bigger problems.

And this is for a culture which still has a homeland where these norms and traditions are practice. You might not see it as much if you see mostly cultural appropriation discussions as they relate to India, but *most* discussions of it have to do with indigenous and native American traditions.

For much of America's history, children would ""play"" at being 'Indians'/Native Americans...but actual, real life native American children were being ripped away from their families and sent to boarding schools where they would be beaten or killed if they tried to practice their religion, speak their native language, or even insist on keeping their own name.

Treating cultural relics, icons, and practice as merely fashion choices in the U.S. leads to their devaluation in the eyes of institutions and governments, which in turn means they are no longer protected because Americans treat them as *only* a fashion choice, instead of a religious or cultural tradition.

**tl;dr - when a colonial or imperial culture picks up pieces of a colonized or oppressed culture, but then otherwise continues to disrespect or persecute that culture, it just stretches out that oppression; it's less relevant if you live in a place where the culture is a majority, but for diaspora members in the West as well as indigenous peoples in the West, it's a big problem**",1651363408

Do you even play cv to know how hard to score high? With all these nerfs on them while they have a hard time breaking a 100k now its more difficult because next update the restoration is nerfed too so basically everything is nerfed like 10 nerfs already

Yes, Niels Kellogg, the same man who convinced generations of American parents to genitally mutilate their kids, convinced people that raising a chimp as a human would produce a fully functioning member of society.

The ape went violent and whistle blowers in the program called it of because they worried the Chimp would LITERALLY eat the baby it was suppose to turn into a human with...

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt; Considering these are our elected officials, Representative of America's voice, I'd like it on the record that we believe Trumps actions were illegal.

Totally agree. The last thing I want to hear is Trump saying that the House Committee didn’t even write a criminal referral (felt the same way about both impeachments), and have him be correct in that statement.  

But I also recognize that 8 televised hearings are going to do exactly the same thing if not more, coupled with the recent judge’s ruling that attorney/client privilege does not cover crimes that Eastman and Trump more likely than not, committed.  And before those hearings, we’ve already heard Committee members point to crimes multiple times in public hearings and in broadcast interviews.  And because criminal referrals are not compelling whatsoever to the DoJ, I will understand if this Committee does every other thing in their power to point out these crimes, short of that piece of paper.  I know Garland and the gang have already been working for several months to make this happen if possible … and they didn’t need a referral to do it.",1651363410

By that logic we should all be using Chademo, which was proposed in 2005 and implemented in 2009, three years before the first Model S was delivered. 

But development timelines are secondary to the point that Tesla's insistence on building a proprietary charging network has become an impediment to broader EV adoption. It's working for them as a company, but it's a problem for having a consistent EV infrastructure. If every EV manufacturer had their own charging format and charging locations that would be bad for everyone, and Tesla is spending a small fortune unnecessarily proving that point. 

&gt;the US is speaking loud and clear, they like the Tesla charging system

People like Tesla cars - do you think Tesla would sell any fewer of them if they used a different charging connector? Has it hurt their sales any in Europe? Would people stop buying Teslas if they had to park next to other brand EVs at charging stations? Get real.",1651363412

The mc was brought there to hush him up without killing him as he found out they were using poached endangered animals in their museums(for fund raising). Instead of killing him, an agent for that company basically drugs him and puts him into the simulation as well.

Let me remind all of you that it's Russia that's supposed to be in a military alliance with Armenia through CSTO, NOT UKRAINE, and it's Putin who considers Armenia a colony of Russia, NOT UKRAINE. It's Putin who signed an alliance with Aliyev, NOT ZELENSKY.",1651363413

We encourage you to resubmit your post though!  Just resubmit and add [Image], [Gif], [Album] or [Video] at the beginning of the title.  We know....we're a bunch of rules Nazi's.  We don't like it either.  The tags just keep things organized, let us set flair automatically, allows for filtering and It also stops bots from posting in this majorly [OC Content] sub, which I think we all agree is a good thing!

"giftcardexchange","t5_2s989","Hello, by trading here you agree that your post follows all of the [**GCX Rules**](https://www.reddit.com/r/giftcardexchange/wiki/rules). If you have not read these, stop and do so now. Here's a condensed list that is absolutely essential to read before you move any further.

* Rule 1: DO NOT accept PMs without a public comment on GCX! Open your post and ensure you can see the comment. If you can't, don't engage with the user as they may be attempting to trick you by disguising a PM as a public comment. Was your post removed and someone immediately sent you a private message? Don't talk with them! Search the [**Universal Scammer List**](https://universalscammerlist.com/search.php). Did you receive a PM from modmail saying you can't sell the gift card on the sub, but you can sell it to the mod team? This is a scam! The mods of /r/giftcardexchange will never offer this ""service"" or ask you to reveal gift card information! Click on the sub name - it's likely a private sub named ""gitfcardexchange"" or ""giftcardexcharge"" attempting to impersonate the real /r/giftcardexchange.
* Rule 2: Investigate your trading partner! Is the account very inactive? Did they just become active and immediately start posting on trade subs? Are they trying to direct you off of Reddit to another site? These are red flags! Double check any links you're sent and ensure they aren't leading to a different domain outside of Reddit.
* Rules 4 and 5: Are you attempting to trade an account balance such as Amazon gift card balance over $250 in value? Are you attempting to trade a single gift card or multiple gift cards over $250 in value? Stop and see the appropriate rule and send in the form to modmail, otherwise your post will be removed and you'll receive an infraction.
* Rule 6: Do you have a prepaid card such as Visa? These cannot be traded for cash equivalents such as PayPal here! GCX is for trading gift cards - see /r/Cash4Cash if it is more appropriate.
* Rule 11: Are you selling a gift card? If you're a ``GCX Beginner`` you can only ask for PayPal Goods &amp; Services! Asking for any other payment method (not including gift cards) will lead to a post removal.

- But a [light pollution filter](https://astrobackyard.com/light-pollution-filters/) for your telescope. 

- Ask neighbors to turn off exterior lights one night a week. Invite them to come look through your telescope on those nights. Serve food and beer. In other words, make a neighborhood star party so they will understand and empathize with your problem. 

- Ask neighbors to install downward facing lights that will direct light downward to the ground. You may need to buy these lights for your neighbors and ask whether you can replace their current lights with these lights. 

- Move your telescope on top of your house or to a nearby building that is above most of the lights. 

- Build a wall around your telescope to block light.

"WarCollege","t5_39t8u","Much like describing ""the fall of the Roman Empire"", the decline of doctrines and technologies rarely happens all at once. Weapons systems will be slightly less economical in some regions until they are supplanted, then experience a resurgence in other regions while their usage on the whole remains on the decline.

Horse cavalry, for example, experienced a ""Golden Age"" with the battlefield dominance of knights. Dedicated heavy armoured cavalry then underwent a decline with the Infantry Revolution. To demonstrate how quickly this could happen, the largest cavalry charge in human history at the Siege of Vienna in 1683 occured just 19 years before the last battle of the Polish Winged Hussars in 1702.

And yet, cavalry remained important for 2 more centuries. Napoleon remarked that ""Without cavalry, battles are without result."". In the 19th century, there were plenty of decisive cavalry actions that could have supported either thesis. Large cavalry formations, even armoured curaissers were maintained and deployed successful well into the Great War, even against machine guns. By 1918, cavalry was no longer as decisive or worth the investment, but the last successful cavalry charge in Europe occured in 1939.

At any point, you could have declared ""cavalry is obsolete"" on a global scale, but that doesnt stop Lawrence of Arabia from overrunning your position with 500 cavalrymen. Cavalry became less and less relevant in fewer and fewer situations.

If anything, I would argue infantry is undergoing the same change, and that commanders are beginning to take note. In the latest Armenia-Azerbaijan War, Armenia had assumed that its superior infantry doctrine would ensure victory twice in a row. Instead, Azerbaijan established air dominance and utilised newly acquired drones to pick apart Armenia infantry formations. A daring historian could argue that this marked the obsolescence of infantry. Beyond counterterrorist operations, you are seeing drones make a difference in near-peer conflicts. In Ukraine, the US is sending experimental drone swarm weapons systems against Russia.

At the same time, Ukraine is also receiving mothballed military assets from other nations and making use of the same T-72s their opponents are using, the same ones they had just neutralised. Russia is issuing Mosin-Nagants to militia units, which is certainly better than nothing. Ukraine is receiving ""obsolete"" APCs that can only withstand small arms fire, but that's certainly better than going into battle in a minivan.

Weapons systems become obsolete when it becomes disadvantageous or an active liability for a force to field and maintain them against a particular enemy. In practice, this is not always a straighforward cost-benefit analysis, and depends on the weapon and situation. You essentially work with what you can get, and weigh the benefits of trying to acquire, utilise and maintain the alternatives.",1651363414

"NoStupidQuestions","t5_2w844","Thanks for your submission /u/PotatoImpossible, but it has been removed for the following reason:

Disallowed question area: **Rant or loaded question** 

NoStupidQuestions is a place to ask any question as long as *it's asked in good faith*. Our users routinely report questions that they feel violate this rule to us. Want to avoid your question being seen as a bad faith question? Common mistakes include (but are not limited to): 

* Rants: Could your question be answered with *'That's awful'* or *'What an asshole'*? Then it's probably a rant rather than a genuine question. Looking for a place to vent on Reddit? Try /r/TrueOffMyChest or /r/Rant instead.

* Loaded questions: Could your question be answered with *'You're right'*? Answering the question yourself, explaining your reasoning for your opinion, or making sweeping assumptions about the question itself all signals that you may not be keeping an open mind. Want to know why people have a different opinion than you? Try /r/ExplainBothSides instead!

* Arguments: Arguing or [sealioning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_lioning) with people giving you answers tells everyone that you have an answer in mind already. Want a good debate? Try /r/ChangeMyView instead!

* Pot Stirring: Did you bring up unnecessary topics in your question? Especially when a topic has to do with already controversial issues like politics, race, gender or sex, this can be seen as trying to score points against the Other Side - and that makes people defensive, which leads to arguments. Questions like *""If _____ is allowed, why isn't _____?""* don't need to have that comparison - just ask *'why isn't ____ allowed?'*.

Disagree with the mods? If you believe you asked your question in good faith, try rewording it or message the mods to see if there's a way you could ask more neutrally. Thanks for your understanding!

"LeaguePBE","t5_2wnyi","Olaf's issues are: Lack of movility. Very limited, yet very exploitable cc. Blurred identity.

This rework fixes none. And moreover, it worsen the last one.

You're turning Olaf even more into another generic aa based champ. More of a Jax wannabe than a champ with his own identity.

His gameplay should be built around his Q's (like Aatrox, Riven, Irelia, ...). I can't understand how misguided pro designers can be to not realize this. And if for the sake of it you have to remove a permaslow that have been an issue for a decade, DO IT. Then you will have options to make a more interesting, more fun and less toxic champ.

Just an example,

Pasive: lower hp =&gt; higher attack speed (classic) and higher movement speed (like 1 per every 5% missing health, max +19).
No slow dependant to chase enemys, safer splitpush, at low hp he picks up more axes, more relevant in teamfights.

Q: Slow REMOVED. Lower the mana cost to 40. Lower base dmg. Higher ad ratio. Everytime he hit's an enemy champ with a Q he gains 1/2/3/4/5 ad (max ? stacks) for ? seconds.
No cc issues, more spamable, you play around picking up and throwing axes, added some risk-reward meaning if you fail a skillshot you're punished loosing the extra dmg, ... FUN.

W: For 3 seconds Olaf slows enemys with his abilitys. He gains life steal and spellvamp for the double of the duration (6 sec).
Keeping his characteristic cc, but limited. Not toxic any more. And he also   mantains his draintank identity. He NEVER needed attack speed on this ability, because he never meant to be an autoattack based champ.

E: Perfect as it is.

R: Inmunity for 6 seconds. Passive permanent defenses.
Simple. Efective. Without conditions that may punish the user (average players shouldn't be afraid of pressing the safe button). If he would need something else, like armor pen (passive and only for himself) or a shield, add here.
To have in the ultimate an ad boost that most of the times Olaf would waste, was the worst idea ever.


... as said, it's just an example. Ofc there are many other posibilitys, and no doubt better ones. But to limit Q's and R's usage? Please... You're wrecking Olaf's core gameplay.

Juggernouts/bruisers already are quite generic. And instead of making the class more diverse, you're making it yet less varied and overall boring.",1651363416

Carl Jung called it ""Synchronicity"": the meaningful coincidence of an inner subjective psychological state and external objective events. For the sake of discussion, even if that is true, what possible significance can even meaningful coincidences have? Beyond the ""uncanny"" appearance of World and Psyche working in momentary - and very rare - cooperation, what can it mean?

Synchronicity doesn't change the basic meaninglessness of life, any more than a few purposeful events in an infinite un-purposeful cosmos can make the world meaningful. Even with meaningful coincidence, we all must still suffer and die. ""A significance to our lives""? Significant to whom or what? Not to the universe, which grinds on indifferently (except for rare Synchronicities); and not to ""God"", since ""He"" created that universe.

If our lives were actually cosmically significant, we would enjoy obvious, exceptional exemptions from the fate of other doomed, suffering organisms. But clearly, we do not. Existence makes no exceptions for us, even if we grant reality to the notion of meaningful coincidence.",1651363416

For Star Wars you have to start with the original trilogy. It's a very special series that should be appreciated and savored in its own right before you move on to the prequels and sequels. It is a bit childish and best seen for the first time as an adolescent, and in order to really enjoy it as an adult you kinda have to turn off your brain and embrace the fantasy. But you should watch it just for the pop culture value.

As for anime, it comes in many different genres, so unless you simply don't like 2D animation or japanese writing styles, there's probably something you'll like and something else you won't like. Even most hardcore anime fans have some selection of anime they're not into.

I feel like you don’t really look happy in any of your photos though which is the major problem. 

Onto your prompts: I actually get your humour in no. 1 and don’t think that necessarily needs to go, although I probably would take it out. You don’t want ambiguity there to be frank; nobody wants to date a potential shoplifter. Your other two prompts feel a bit uninspired. I don’t wish to stereotype, but the fact is that a lot more men are into their cars than women, so chances are most of your potential matches are not going to share this passion. You want your prompts to be something they can relate to, and whilst I see you drive a BMW which is nice and all for you, this is still just showing a side to you that most women will probably be indifferent about. The jacuzzi prompt makes limited sense given you haven’t even said what your career is, and again it’s not exactly a conversation starter.

God knows how Spurs got there. They shouldn't have even made it out of the group. Barcelona utterly demolished them in London then topped the group. Last match-day. Inter were through if they won against PSV, whilst Spurs had to go to Camp Nou, not lose and also hope Inter dropped points. It seemed set that Inter would finish second with Barcelona.

Barcelona, having mathematically topped the group already, sent out a c list team (to the point where one of the 'experienced' players was Ousmane Dembele - who was something like 21 at the time and had barely played a game for Barcelona) to gain some minutes whilst the main players (Messi and co.) rested.

Dembele scored one of the most underappreciated solo goals you'll ever see (seriously, nobody ever talks about [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmwmIwR6k40&amp;ab_channel=X_xavi_X) goal), but then Spurs managed to equalise and finish the game 1-1 (quite impressive at Camp Nou at the time) whilst Inter lost 2-1 to PSV (shocking everyone) and so Spurs went through on goal difference.

They then had Dortmund, City and Ajax before conceding 2 minutes into the final against Liverpool.

Utterly bizarre. I can't comprehend it.

To me the 'real' final that season was between Liverpool and Barcelona. Certainly, that's the tie everyone remembers.",1651363417

Same goes for funerals - I'd pick something where I wouldn't stand out, but I'm not buying a suit. It's not Victorian times any more, gramps. I wouldn't be inflaming anyone by not wearing black leather shoes, black trousers, a white or black shirt, black tie, black jacket, and matching black umbrella.

To me it sounds like she had a serious underlying illness that wasn't being resolved which led her to that - which in my eyes isn't as clear cut as just mental illness.

"relationship_advice","t5_2r0cn","I was like you when I first lost my virginity. Waited a long time with first boyfriend and then it sort of felt like a favour/chore. I hadn’t really explored on my own so I just did what he wanted and played along.

My best advice is read some erotic literature. There are free short stories online or you can download some books on kindle or whatever. Try different genres and see what gets your attention. 100% get a vibrator. Get something small and cute to start with and give yourself some alone time.

When you are comfortable and have figured yourself out you can invite the bf back. Some partners are really supportive and great and want to be along for the journey. You could feel that out with him. Maybe he’s into toys. Maybe you can suggest he look up some oral tips. If you’re working with your bf you need to make it fun. This is the time to explore and enjoy it. 

Women tend to get in their heads more and that makes the fun part harder. I found erotic lit really helpful for helping me figure out what gets me hot and keeping my mind off everything else. I have trouble talking about my needs and wants because I grew up conservative. I can only talk about it right after sex which is totally useless lol
Don’t feel bad about asking for space and for exploring. But if you keep the relationship you will need to figure out how to work together.
Good luck!",1651363419

And I never claimed that. You do not have to wonder if the Soviets find out because an event that big is hard to hide and the USSR was being leaked information regarding the bomb.  

The Soviet campaign against Japan was later than America's because Japan didn't declare war on them and they were busy dealing with the majority of Nazi forces. Plus Russia is big and mobilising troops to that part of the world took time, same as it did for the British to transfer forces there leading to a far higher percentage of British forces being Australian than in other theatres.",1651363420

1792 Full Proof Store Pick (125 Proof): I didn’t know how good this bottle was when I bought it otherwise I would have bought two. It’s one of my favorite bottles and the only reason it isn’t gone is because I haven’t seen another and have been trying to save it until I can find a backup. Despite my tendency to prefer higher proofs, I still think this one will win despite the 12 point proof disadvantage because…   
  
VS.  
  
Dry Fly Distilling Specialty Barrel 7-Year, Store Pick (137.12 Proof, Barrel #455): This is the worst bottle of whiskey I’ve ever had. Since I got into bourbon, I’ve purchased bottles entirely based on recommendations and research. I’m a cheap guy who doesn’t work in a high-paying job, and so before I drop $30-$100 on a bottle, I try to ensure that it will be something that I’ll at least appreciate if not enjoy. This bottle is the one time I broke that rule and it did me dirty. I saw this store pick and had never seen the bottle before. I’d never had anything from Washington either and, when I saw the high proof, I had to give it a shot. Unfortunately, every time I’ve tried it, I’ve had the same experience and so has everyone I’ve given it to. I refuse to drain pour anything and so I’m hoping my the lack of bias in this blind (for as long as it lasts anyway-seeing as I believe these two will be easy to distinguish) will make this bottle better than I remember.   
  
Glass A Nose: Smoked wood and peat. They’re overwhelming and I struggle to get anything else from this. It feels like there might be the faintest hints of something floral (rosemary?) or fruity on the end, but they are so overwhelmed by the smoked wood and peat. I can already tell that this is the Dry Fly, and I will say I actually appreciate this nose more than I ever had before despite how one-note it is.   
  
Glass A Palate: It tastes like I stuck my hand in my backyard and ate a mouthful of dirt and grass. Still very peaty. And that’s it.  
  
Glass A Finish: The finish is better than I remember. I actually even think I like it this time around. The spice sticks around for a while, but it’s the same gross flavors.   
  
Glass A Rating: 3  
  
  
Glass B Nose: Mmm mmm. It smells like cherry and coke, but not like the flavored cherry coke. The cherry smell is more poignant than that like you just opened up a jar of maraschino cherries. I also get a bit of nuttiness and some pepper spice. It is less overwhelming than A but the profile is so much better.   
  
Glass B Palate: Very good. The high proof of the Dry Fly dims the tastes more than how I remember them. Still a good bit of cherry and nuts. Even then it is still lovely.   
  
Glass B Finish: Still love this finish, just like drinking a cherry coke and stays sweet. It’s impressive how much the Dry Fly dims both the palate and finish because this doesn’t taste nearly as poignant as I remember.   
  
Glass B Rating: 8  
  
Conclusion &amp; Reveal:  
  
Glass A: Dry Fly  
  
Glass B: 1792  
  
The Dry Fly was honestly better than I remembered but still not good. I feel like it might be a good drink for someone who likes scotch, but I despise scotch and so it just doesn’t sit well with me. I’d love to see someone else review this because I feel bad talking so much crap on it, but it just doesn’t do it for me. The 1792 FP is as good as everyone says. I can’t wait to find another so I can start drinking my current bottle more often than I already do.

Formula Vee &gt; F4 (iR-04) &gt; F3 &gt; FR3.5 &gt; F1

The F4 is new, so it's fairly popular. F3 is probably the most popular formula car, but with it comes a reputation for being a bit messy in the lower splits. FR3.5 is less popular, but has a great community and great racing. And finally F1 with the new Mercedes W12 has been fairly popular; less so now that the launch hype has died down, but it's still going strong. Also keep in mind, iRacing will also be building the W13 ""soon"" so we have that to look forward to.

My advice would be to take your time. Just because you can get to Class A license doesn't mean you should or have to. Take the time to build your skills up in the lower ranks, and it will make you a better racer when you get to F1.",1651363421

italy is declining because the old mentality never went away, italy is a stagnating country, italy is stagnating is because younger people are a very, very SMALL minority with no power whatsoever..

the general mentality has been the same for the last 30 years, this old mentality has made extremely hard the inclusion of technology in company settings ..boomers absolutely dominate in italy and it's safe to call italy a gerontocracy consindering all the power they have here.

now the same boomers that refused any change for the last 30 years are the vast majority in demographic terms, this is the same demographic with which russian propaganda thrives on, consindering the fact that every year around 100k young people leave the country..

it wouldn't surprising ( if anything it should be expected) to see italy  do a complete 180° and going pro-russia even if it angers Nato or the EU, russian propaganda seeped too deep and putin is extremely popular among boomers

italy is imposing sactions because Mario Draghi controls the Technical government and is pro ukraine, but you still need to remember that these sactions are extremely unpopular among the boomers who hold all the power culturally so as soon as they get the chance they'll vote to lift those sanctions amd go on to the russian side",1651363421

And then when you join groups like cptsd groups or psychedelic healing groups, you're still dealing with people that are deluded into believing that there is a solution to being sexually abused as a child (my case). All this meditation and drugs and bullshit. It's sad. It's sad that people who write these fucking books like the body keeps the score, etc are put on a pedestal. People are genuinely happy and cuddle their diagnoses or their spiritual beliefs despite them not bringing any sort of comfort. I've been lying to myself about having hope in this world. 

People suggesting therapy is just passing the buck to people they don't know. I've never been this fucking suicidal in my life. I purposely moved to a more progressive part of the United States under the pretense that there would be people out here more attuned to helping injured people. This fucking sucks. Everything sucks. Fuck groups where they sit around and use some psychological text as their goddamn Bible because I know that if I didn't have these issues, I wouldn't be reading pieces of literary shit like the body keeps the score. The only one scoring here are the heady egotistical fucks that write this analysis to soothe their own egos. 

I'm scared. I'm dissociated. I need help and swear to God there isn't any help. I can't accept that this is the human condition because I don't want to go on.

The truth is that I'm afraid of getting attached to someone because my attachment with my parents was endlessly toxic. My own parents were the ones that breathed life into my own demise. If there's anything worth killing yourself over, it's shit like that.",1651363421

Couples looking for a unicorn will often say they want someone to ""join"" their family. Poly triads are not (AB)+C. C isn't ""joining"" anything. You all will create something completely new; four different relationships that all need time and attention. A+B (as with any major life change, your relationship dynamic will probably shift), B+C, A+C, and A+B+C.

We liked the plot of the half-demon witch and that they failed to explode. Kaela, good, I like it. But they would have made a farewell final season and a new reboot of 0.",1651363422

I keep a clean microfiber cloth near my shower, and wipe down the door upon getting out of the shower. Takes less than 30 seconds. I have several of these, and after 2 uses, it goes into the laundry and a new one is hung up for use.

Once a month when I do my ""deep clean"" of a mostly clean bathroom (I clean up something most every day), I wipe both sides down with Windex (using a microfiber cloth as well).

"Retconned","t5_3fft0","Good points. I've read the grave reusing thing hasn't ever been common in the U.S. as it is in Europe. It's actually been avoided but now cemeteries are getting so crowded (especially in and around major cities) that it's being debated if it should be implemented. I'm sure its been done in the U.S. but everything I've found says its rare. Most states in the U.S. guarantee a plot forever...the state itself ensures the cemeteries maintain the grave forever essentially. I'm sure there are some old hidden/grown over cemeteries here and there that have a few people buried, and I'm sure some very very old cemeteries have been destroyed or paved over when no one was looking. I don't think those are that significant in light of the overall numbers though.",1651363423

"lucifer","t5_2sbp9","This all ages quite well. I’m rewatching but even into the new episodes of season 5 and 6, Maze endlessly betrays her closest friends mainly Lucifer. She teams with Amenadiel then Kane and then Michael all serving as foils to Lucifer just trying to live his life and ideally do so with Chloe.
She talks about how weak and selfish everyone is, but it’s her own feelings about herself being projected onto them. Mind you she does feel bad about herself constantly and goes on and on how she’s this “evil bad terrible nasty demon” descriptions no one has used on her except herself. Funny that the one time she is persecuted for being a demon when Linda learns that Lucifer is truly the Devil and thus Maze is actually a demon; Maze pleads with her that she is still the same entity and that she’s a worthy friend - that just because she’s a demon doesn’t mean she’s evil or that she would hurt Linda or anyone else undeserving.
Frequent flip flopping. I don’t like it. Maze has been Lucifer’s loyal ally for eons and eons yet in a few brief years on earth she betrays him countless times putting him in situations that could literally kill him or her herself swinging hell forged blades at him with intent to kill if he didn’t dodge the hit.
Also I don’t like how strong they pump her up to be at certain times. Against Uriel she gets rocked pretty fast with minimal effort. Later she is able to square off for a long bout against Lucifer and block the punch of a full strength Amenadiel headed toward Michael. She holds her ground against Lucifer and Amenadiel briefly as well. Lucifer does eventually put her down at which point Michael asks her to toss him a blade and tries to murder a random human to distract Lucifer who has gained the upper hand as Amenadiel and him regroup ready to attack 2v1 against Michael and finish the worthless coward.
Funny no punishment for attempting to murder a human. I guess because most punishment is self-actualized and he doesn’t ever feel bad so he can’t lose his power or wings like what happened to Lucifer and Amenadiel.
Regardless Maze can be extremely angelic level powerful when it fits the script.
Likewise when there isn’t enough adversaries against Lucifer she is immediately rewritten from friend to foe.
It betrays her very nature itself!
Dromos wages a small rebellion plot against Lucifer on earth requiring Lucifer to return to hell for thousands of hell years, half a human year.
Yet he is still a trusted demon working for Lucifer a few episodes later.
He immediately returns to subordinate or risk being destroyed.
Maze you would think truly caring for Lucifer would do the same and learn from her mistakes.
Plus it’s ridiculous why would Lucifer take her back to hell with him when she just screwed him over majorly?
He might just kill her instead.
Or trap her in punishment to live out life on earth.
But give her what she wants after destroying his love life and trying to hurt people he cares for? Making Lucifer a murder fugitive whom could never visit LA again?
Yeah real smart Maze.
I love her character that’s why it’s so hard to watch her be against the crew.",1651363424

"pokemon","t5_2qmeb","Oh where to start? First and foremost, it just doesn't feel like Pokémon to me. Not that's off course just my opinion but to me, Pokémon evolution is supposed to show how your Pokémon is getting stronger alongside you. But mega evolution just reverts back at the end of battle. That's not Pokémon Evolution, that's Digivolution.

Second, mega evolution is supposed to be showing off the strong bond between Pokémon and trainer, but you can just put a mega stone on a freshly caught Pokémon and mega evolve it like that. Where is that 'special bond'?

Third, mega evolution only happens to the final evolution of a Pokémon evolution line (otherwise we would have gotten mega Pikachu). Meaning that all Pokémon that got a mega evolution will probably never get another proper evolution. Now this is way much less of a problem right now than it was back then with regional variants now being a thing and new evolutions being introduced through them rather than just being added like they did in Gen 2 and 4. Still, all those Pokémon that have less that 3 stages but got a mega are now pretty much stuck like that. 

A few in rapid fire mode: Megas make the games feel unfair since you can use them in any battle but your opponent usually has no access to them. They're the first and in my opinion worst sign of obvious Gen 1 pandering. Most Pokémon can't mega evolve so you are less free in your team selection if you want your team to be strong. It has been hinted at that at least some Pokémon are in constant agony as they mega evolve. The mechanic was criminally underused in the games where it was supposed to be 'the big new thing', then swept under the rug in the next gen and completely removed thereafter. They had to make up a parallel universe for these games to take place in to have it make sense for crying out loud.

To conclude my ramblings: mega evolution is a 'press here to win battle' button in 9 out of 10 battles, only you don't even get to decide which Pokémon you can use it on. To be fair, I know it's different in competitive (which I don't play). But in normal casual gameplay, it just feels wrong to me.

Hi!
What I need help with: 
I feel like I’m very inconsistent in looking good, only with specific angles and with makeup. I can’t bring myself to do anything more than like, liner for an everyday look without feeling gross. Anything on my skin that’s not my lips or eyes (don’t do my brows but want to, I feel like I could balance my face better if I learned) definitely hate mascara now, especially on my soft face. 
Is there anything I can do that involves brows, eyeshadow/liner, maybe some concealer. And specifically what can I do. 
I love how my lashes look curled, but haven’t found anything that actually stays. Thinking of falsies but I’m broke as fuck and the upkeep scares me. 
Also -  not normally this red. Am currently camping at beach

That poor pupper. PARVO is a hideous illness. 

It has a 90% survival rate *if started early.*

Definitely press her to surrender the dog. If it doesn't look good, or the vet chooses, it may end up being put down. Better than the alternative. 

It's not your fault if the pupper dies, but your sister's. You don't buy a puppy unless you have the several hundred up front to make sure it gets its shots. After that, it's still a lifelong expense for maintenance meds to prevent things like heartworms. When old age hits, BOY, you open your wallet and watch the money sail away.
