Ask him about the sweater he is wearing.

Ask him which is his favourite Cosby Sweater.

Ask him how he thinks contemporary sweaters compare to sweaters from the 1980s.

Show him four photos, each of a sweater from the 70s, 80s, 90s, and 00s. See if he can identify which sweater comes from each era. (I bet he will get all four right).

Ask him for his thoughts on the sweaters in the pictures.

Lead in to asking him about sweaters generally. Where does he stand on sweaters today?

What does he believe are the important and defining moments in sweater history?

How does he feel that he fits into that history?
  If he's modest - big him up a bit and discuss his influence in the worlds of sweaters and fashion.

Where does he see sweaters going in the future.

HERE COMES THE MONEY QUESTION: Stay cool when you deploy this one. Remember we'll all be rooting for you. And we'll all be counting on you.

Ask Bill Cosby: what is the future of the Cosby Sweater?

What kinds of sweaters will we be seeing him wearing over the next five, ten, twenty years?

Turn up the heat a bit and push for those details.

Then you can turn the heat down some and make a relaxing segue into this next question:

Ask him to reminisce and tell a funny story about a sweater (remember he was also a comedian once).

Was that story he just told about a Cosby Sweater?
  Yes - does he still posses the said sweater? Where is it now? Has anything else funny happened to it?
  No - hahaha thanks Bill, that was a funny story. Tell me another but this time about a Cosby Sweater?

Other than championing sweaters, what else does he feel has been an important achievement in his life?

Did these other activities involve sweaters? In what capacities?

After you have pissed him off with sweater questions give him a tough time over cancelling House of Cosbys.

If the C compiler is removing a loop because it can prove that the loop will terminate and produce no visible state changes (side-effects) then that is a valid optimization.

That's not what's happening here. In this case, some C compilers removed a loop that they were unsure about. Turns out the loop never terminates, and if a C compiler removes a non-terminating loop from a program, that C compiler is broken.

Reference C99 sections 5.1.2.3 paragraph 3, 6.8 paragraph 2, and 6.8.5 paragraph 4.

&gt;There are behaviors, intentions, cultural practices, etc. which potentially lead to the worst possible misery for everyone. There are also behaviors, intentions, cultural practices, etc. which do not

This is actually incorrect and I think he already knows this.  That second sentence is not a full sentence, I chopped it in half, but it appears to be sneaking something in.  I'll assume you agree with the first sentence, I do as well.  The problem is that on a casual reading the second sentence appears to mirror the first, when in fact it does not.  Notice that the word ""potentially"" is removed from the second sentence.  While I would agree with the statement, ""there are behaviors, intentions, cultural practices, etc. which potentially do not lead to the worst possible misery for everyone,"" I cannot agree with the statement, ""there are behaviors, intentions, cultural practices which do not lead to the worst possible misery for everyone.""  I can't agree with this not because I know it isn't true, but because I don't know whether or not it is true, even in principle.  Is there a set of behaviors, intentions and cultural practices that will *never* in any context lead to misery for everyone?  Do all actions have an inevitable set of consequences in a deterministic universe, or is it possible that the same action repeated in the same circumstance will sometimes have a different outcome, and thus spawn a different chain of events?  If we admit that actions as a whole are not, in fact, split cleanly down the middle as potentially either leading to misery for everyone or not, don't we have to further admit that any given action which could potentially lead to misery for everyone may also not lead to misery?  In other words, that we don't really know the question we are asking from the beginning, we don't have two groups of distinctly divided actions from which to test our empirical hypotheses.

Then we come to the rest of the sentence, the part that I think most trained philosophy students would pounce on first.

&gt;and which, in fact, lead to states of wellbeing for many sentient creatures, to the degree that wellbeing is possible in this universe.

What is well-being?  This might seem silly or academic, perhaps he is asserting well-being as a simple overall ""good"" state for individuals or society, but obviously as a utilitarian well-being is absolutely central to Harris, we need to know exactly what this constitutes.  If it is ""good"" states, then we beg the question of what is good, and whether it applies universally.  Without knowing exactly what it is, we can't know if it is even possible to maximize or minimize well-being for people who may have disparate values.

Is it happiness?  For most utilitarians it is, but Harris seems to avoid this in order to avoid the classical responses.  Perhaps happiness is one of the values secondary to overall well-being?  For example, he seems to make clear that ""liberty"" is a secondary value to well-being.  Is this correct?  What if there existed someone who was given all the conditions to satisfy their well-being *except* for liberty and offered a choice between this life and one in which they have liberty but have good reason to believe the other secondary conditions will not be fulfilled.  Isn't it possible that some people (very few, I would guess, but some) would chose liberty over and ahead of all other measures of well-being?  If so, doesn't this indicate that for those people, the fundamental value they are attempting to maximize or minimize is not ""well-being"" at all, but ""liberty""?  Sure, we could say that they are arriving at a relative well-being through liberty, but then we are admitting at the outset that well-being is relative.  That is to say, to maximize the well-being of those who fundamentally value liberty most we cannot maximize the well-being of those who do not simultaneously, there must be some compromise for one or both parties along the way.  And this doesn't even get into those for whom maximization of liberty constitutes distinctly different methodologies (i.e. even amongst those who seek to maximize liberty instead of other well-being attributes there will be reasonable disagreement).

Anyway, all of this is fun (for me anyway!) and I think there is much more that can be said in response to the fact sheet, but this begins to depart from the point I was originally making before Harris showed up.  I think I found a blogger who puts it a  better than I did, and it response to Harris himself.  Here are a few passages, but you might want to read the whole thing as it includes links to Harris and others who have responded to him:

&gt;First, the role of consensus. In formal reasoning, we all recognize the difference between axioms and deductions. We start by assuming some axioms, and the laws of logic allow us to draw certain conclusions from them. It’s not helpful to argue that the axioms are “wrong” — all we are saying is that if these assumptions hold, then  we can safely draw certain conclusions....

&gt;When it comes to morality, we indeed have a very similar situation. If  we all agree on a set of starting moral assumptions, then we constitute a functioning community that can set about figuring out how to pass moral judgments. And, as I emphasized in the original post, the methods and results of science can be extremely helpful in that project, which is the important and interesting thing that we all agree on, which is why it’s a shame to muddy the waters by denying the fact/value distinction or stooping to insults. But I digress....

&gt;The problem, obviously, is that we don’t all agree on the assumptions, as far as morality is concerned. Saying that everyone, or at least all right-thinking people, really want to increase human well-being seems pretty reasonable, but when you take the real world seriously it falls to pieces. And to see that, we don’t have to contrast the values of fine upstanding bourgeois Americans with those of Hitler or Jeffrey Dahmer. There are plenty of fine upstanding people — you can easily find them on the internet! — who think that human well-being is maximized by an absolute respect for individual autonomy, where people have equal access to primary goods but are given the chance to succeed or fail in life on their own. Other people think that a more collective approach is called for, and it is appropriate for some people to cede part of their personal autonomy — for example, by paying higher taxes — in the name of the greater good....

&gt;Now, we might choose to marshall arguments in favor of one or another of these viewpoints. But those arguments would not reduce to simple facts about the world that we could in principle point to; they would be appeals to the underlying moral sentiments of the individuals, which may very well end up being radically incompatible.

This is essentially my original point, do you think Harris challenges this successfully?","1272672065"
"atheism","t5_2qh2p","&gt; You're being obtuse.  The assumption was around 90% of the victims are male, yes?

Only after you asserted that.  Which was well after I objected to your original only-a-citation comment.

&gt; Where along this chain, exactly, do I exhibit poor reading comprehension? **Where, exactly.** Demonstrate it, or cease this nonsense.

Well, to give one explicit example, we have the following which you clearly failed to acknowledge as having existed whatsoever:

&gt; &gt;` `No, I didn't cite a study that 75% of the victims were male. I cited a study that 25% OF THE VICTIMS WERE FEMALE

&gt; ... The two statements are subsets of one another.

And here's another:

"Frugal","t5_2qhbe","4.75% is pretty low. There may well be other things you can put your money into that have a higher ROI. For example, you're paying US$300 a year to go to the gym. If you're going to the gym for access to the equipment, and you could buy equipment that would substitute for the gym for US$1000 (and that would fit in your house!) you'd be making 30% on that money. Tax-free! That's a much better way to spend your money than paying off a 4.75% loan.

Now, maybe if you bought the equipment you wouldn't really use it; it's a bit of a gamble. If you buy it off Craigslist, you can at least sell it for the same price if you don't use it.

4.75% risk-free, tax-free ROI isn't a *bad* deal; it's a lot better than anything you can get in the stock market. But there may be a lot of things in your day-to-day life with a better ROI than that. Here are some ideas:

* If you bought a bicycle, maybe you could save both gym costs and train fare, and augment your mobility to boot. Myself, I always prefer the US$50 garage-sale specials, but my friends who are into biking tell me that a really nice bike (&gt;US$1000) can make the difference between hating biking and loving it. If you try to go that route, you should definitely talk to bicycling friends to get advice on what bike to get. [Edit: oops, I see you say you already bike a lot. So that's a way you could possibly be more frugal without even spending any money.]
* If you invited your friends over to your apartment more, you could spend less money on eating out (which I'm guessing is most of that ""incidental"" US$1050 per month). Are there things you could buy that would make that more feasible? A couch, a foof chair, better cooking utensils, a crock pot, a deep freeze, a bread maker?

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","You need some positive reinforcement. Sit down with your friends and tell them all -- at the same time-- that you're having issues with body image and to help you out. Like a reverse intervention of sorts. Tell them you need more positive reinforcement about your looks. Explain that you know there's nothing really wrong, and you're healthy, but deep down you can't get rid of the feeling. Have them help you help yourself-- monitoring your food intake so you don't starve yourself is #1, positive comments about your body, and about bodies in general (outlaw ragging on less flattering body types), positive distractions, maybe partnering with one or more of the girls as a gym buddy?

A therapist is a good idea, but they're just going to reinforce the topics above. IANAD, but I think that talking to your friends and engaging them to help you will do a lot more good than talking it out with a shrink. 

Overall know this-- you are never going to change your bone structure. Your wide hips are here to stay, so take comfort in knowing that many women envy this body type (wide sexy hips? hell yeah!) and many men desire it. Your breasts may grow with time, but don't place too much stock in it. Short of surgery there's nothing you can do. I beg you not to starve yourself or feel guilty for eating, because no amount of dieting will change your bone structure or reduce your hip size. It is cool to eat bread and hamburgers and soda (in moderation of course). 

Being a teenager and having body image woes is just about as low as it goes. It *does* get better. You don't have to accept that your body is fine just the way it is right now, but make it a long term goal. Get comfortable! Enjoy the fact that you don't have back-problem-inducing breasts. Enjoy the fact that you still fit into jeans small enough to be a model. Heck, enjoy the fact that you are so slim that it is not recommended you donate blood due to your petite body size.

&gt; So now that we're going to be making $85k a year without upside, Joe Mainstreet is going to have his revenge, right? Wrong! Guess what: we're going to stop buying the new 80k car, we aren't going to leave the 35 percent tip at our business dinners anymore. No more free rides on our backs.

Good fuck, people still believe in that trickle-down crap?  We're not all gardeners and waiters.  Does he think that somehow the fraction of his income that he spends back into the economy somehow is equivalent to the trillions of dollars that has been bled from the economy as a result of Wall Street's gaming of the system?

Overall this guy seems to be convoluting *personal* gain with *overall gains in the economy*.  If the system is functioning properly, yes, those two things go together. People are angry because these people made money, while the *rest of us lost money and jobs*.  That is no longer the work of a good, hard-working Wall Street banker; it is fraud.","1272672158"

Mark Shuttleworth brands himself as a ""benevolent dictator for life"", but it seems he's taking the role too seriously. While ""too many cooks spoil the broth"" has merit in some cases, asking the community what they want has value. It  seems all decisions are made behind closed doors at Canonical, and then announced to the public, already finalized.

A community that's ignored does not thrive, and I suspect Ubuntu would never have gotten off the ground if not for a number of enthusiastic power users. Alienating them does no good, but plenty of harm.","1272672163"

Servers are not ever under any circumstances in the USA allowed to earn less than minimum wage ever. If their wages + tips = minimum wage they can get the lower wage from the employer as long as the server makes enough tips to meet the minimum wage. If the server does not make enough in tips+wages to earn the minimum wage the employer must directly contribute the remainder. That or similar language is in ever summary of minimum wage laws as they apply to tippers.

You can look at a Department of Labor page: http://www.dol.gov/dol/topic/wages/wagestips.htm

** If the employee’s tips combined with the employer’s direct wages of at least $2.13 per hour do not equal the federal minimum hourly wage, the employer must make up the difference. Many states, however, require higher direct wage amounts for tipped employees.**

There is no situation where it is legal for a server to earn less than minimum wage at any point. Your whole argument isn't anything more than hand waving and hoping everyone else is either ignorant or as dumb as you are.

"scifi","t5_2qh2z","Don't try to put layers on it. Believe me, I **get** it.

I put so much venom against the Watchmen movie on internet boards I was halfway to a dissertation as to *why* Watchmen-as-it-is-loved is *only* possible in a graphic medium.

I will never pass up a chance to tell people to not watch the new Star Trek movie over the old ones. 

I **still** idly wonder why the Fantastic Four, John Constantine, and Superman's appeal seem to completely elude anyone in Hollywood. 

I was bitching on the internet about how X-Men: The Last Stand was downright criminal and took a shit on what was shaping up to be the Altman of superhero movies as it came out.

But here's the thing, in spite of **all** of that, they're just movies. 

Shitty shitty movies made solely under the banner of avarice by businessmen and commercial artists who genuinely and truly believe that if something says 'superhero' then you have a right to lazy plotting, poor characterization and dialogue, and that anything even slightly ridiculous is worth neutering; and that if something says ""comic book"" and features the *slightest* amount of mysticism, heroism, or action must be **hammered** into the superhero mold; and has their head so far up the cinematic medium's ass that they refuse to acknowledge graphic medium as anything more than detailed storyboards, but movies nonetheless.

Fiction itself is *extremely* mutable and continuity has always meant shit. Go ask anyone who reads the Bible, or any expert in Greek mythology, or Hindu mythology. 

It is older than dirt to see someone take any form of mythology and twist the details to serve their own agenda.

Look at what bloody Shakespeare does with Greek myth in A Midsummer Night's Dream, the hack. 

And even though Hollywood is a greedy beast, it is arguably more pure in its intention than medieval passion plays, which use the bloody crucifixion as an excuse to forward Anti-Semitism.

Jonah Hex is no more a sacred cow than Jesus or any other piece of mythology and whoever holds the creative license to his character can do **whatever** they want with him. Be glad he's not played by Shia LeBouf and has a robot buddy. 

I also know what you're saying about the problem with Hollywood using its wide distribution to sour the public consciousness on a given property. The fact that most people will never give the tiniest shit about Watchmen as a comic but paid good money to see--and dismiss--an inferior movie is a huge source of ire with me. 

But it's going to happen, and while you have a right to be angry just know that when you claim Hollywood ""rapes your childhood"" you're sounding **stupid** and **immature**, no matter the validity of your statement.

If you need to lash out, then lash out. That's ok. I've done it enough. Write up exactly what you feel but don't post it until you've edited it down to a reasoned and mature phrasing that doesn't make your argument seem fallacious. Less people will be able to discredit you via ad hominem and will be more inclined to listen to what you have to say.

That's my point. Just relax. MST3K mantra.

    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10000; i++); /* waits about 1 sec */

"programming","t5_2fwo","&gt; So compilers should be aware of Fermat's Last Theorem so that they can determine whether these types of loops terminate?

No. A compiler should do whatever it thinks gives the most reward (speedup) for its efforts (how many types of loops it recognizes). A loop that it is unsure about (like this one) should simply not be optimized away. Only those loops that are guaranteed to terminate (by whatever effort the compiler wishes to endure) can be removed.

Think of it this way - the burden of proof is on the compiler. If it wishes to remove a loop, it must prove it does terminate and it has no side effects. If it can't prove this, it can't remove the loop.

&gt; I can't think of any case where you'd want to enter an infinite loop that had no side effects on values outside the loop (including no memory accesses).

It doesn't matter what you can and can't think of. What matters is if a compiler, claiming to compile the C language, actually conforms to the C language.

In general, this subreddit is for tinkerers, so I'll tell you know what I know about the two standards and why you're unlikely to find a cheap converter:
What has to happen to go from NTSC ('yellow component RCA video') encoding to any VGA setting (which now supports many resolutions to NTSC's one) is that the video signal must be read through an ADC into a buffer and resampled appropriately for your particular monitor. This gets the signal to the right resolution for your monitor, which may not even have the same aspect ratio as a 4:3 television. Then, an analog VGA signal has to be constructed from this resampled data and sent out to the monitor. (There are probably analog ways to do the resampling, too, but I doubt they're commonly used). Especially because your monitor's resolution could be one of a large number of possible values, it takes a certain amount of intelligence to do the conversion.","1272672266"

This point has come up again and again, although it does seem that most people are fairly aware of the facts, but rather ignore them on the basis that their vote does have an impact on who will be invited to form a government... 

There is another issue however that is not often explored. That is whether a strong party leader (and a strong 'central office') is desirable, after all parties are there to keep their MP's in line to a certain degree, it is arguable that a weak party and a weak party leader means that more autonomy and indeed more power is devolved (nt the right term, but you get my drift) to individual MP's in that party, it also means that the government cannot rely on a majority to push its issues through...  

Of course taking that point to it's logical conclusion (that you choose between a representative who represents you, or a party that represents you...)  gives some weight to the argument that people should vote on the basis of national matters and indeed do so tactically on the basis of party preference, rather than on local matters and constituency issues.","1272672275"

Willful ignorance. I hates it. 

I recently stood up for my atheist beliefs to a newly reformed Christian friend. I was never able to defend my faith back in the day when I was thought I was Christian so it surprised me. Our conversation also was circular and here's a part of it:

She starts with, ""What makes your heart beat?""

I say, ""My blood.""

""What makes your blood pump?""

""Uh, my muscles.""

""What makes your muscles move?"" (at this point, I can't figure out where she's going with this, or what answer she wants) 

""Electrical impulses sent by my brain.""

""And what tells the impulses what to do?""

""Neurons...  ...?"" (High school was forever ago... my memory struggled)

She gives me a blank stare

""Uh, synapses... firing.""

She says, ""You can't explain everything!""

I say, ""You're right. I don't -know- everything. But I'll answer your questions as best as I can and when I can't, I'll turn to a doctor, or a scientist, someone who has the education and training--and I'll get you an answer.""


Ultimately, neither of our stances changed, or were influenced by the other. And she finally broke the conversation to show me a random music video with a curt explanation that 'If you put your trust in God, you don't need any answers.""

I shook my head, ""That's not enough for me anymore. The answers matter.""

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","I'm glad you now understand that many organs do come from dead donors.

&gt; No, if you have one insurance type that covers the cost of transplants then you'd expect it to be relatively expensive. If you have a second that doesn't cover that cost well then that should cost no more then it does now.

That's exactly what I said. Again, it would raise the cost of some insurance, not affect others. Overall the cost would increase, while depriving many people of body parts for their survival. I'm glad we agree. It's a strong argument against selling body parts.

&gt;If you had a choice between dying or taking a transplant (from someone compatible) that wasn't ideal (e.g. liver from an alchy or heart from someone obese.) Would you do it? You'd likely get at least some time out of the ""non-ideal"" organ while they try and find an ""ideal"" one.

*They can do that now. People don't.* People could get those poor organs now. When you're already dying due to a failing organ, taking another weak one doesn't help. You need a healthy one. Having it cost money wouldn't change that.

&gt;How is that different from someone wanting to end it early to collect life-insurance or save their family the medical bills from their treatment? I mean, yes, its a really shitty thing to have happen but its also fairly uncommon.

Life insurance pays out the same regardless of when you die. It's also against virtually all life insurance policies to pay out on suicide. Additionally, being unable to afford to continue care due to lack of money is different than getting money to die early. That's buying part of someone's life. It's a strong argument against placing value on human body parts. I do agree that it is shitty though.

&gt; There is currently exploitation by the Chinese and I don't see anyone doing anything about it. As far as selling a person goes, see my previous example with adoption.

Again, we've already established that it's illegal in China. Either way, Chinese legal enforcement doesn't matter. In China people buy wives and sell daughters, or even kill them because they're only allowed to have one child. That doesn't make selling body parts good. It seems more to me like an argument against it.

Again, while birth mothers often get money, *she still doesn't have to turn over the baby*. Adoptive mothers often want to give up their children, just as organ donors want to donate their organs. However a contract in that regard in unenforceable, even in exchange for payment. You can't legally sell people, even a baby. [Please read more](http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/1730428/how_is_baby_selling_different_from.html) [or here](http://encyclopedia.adoption.com/entry/baby-selling/53/1.html)

&gt;This is a far cry from human trafficking. One requires essentially kidnapping someone and taking them somewhere to basically be a slave while the other requires an adult making an informed choice or leaving that choice with people he/she trusts. These are two quite different things.

Learn more about human trafficking. People usually aren't kidnapped. They're usually tricked into it or sold into it by family members in financial need. The exact same thing would happen if value was placed on parts of their body as on the whole. Again, a powerful argument against selling body parts.

After all of these arguments against selling for body parts, there's no good argument in support of it. It would cost everyone more, shorten many lives, provide no additional benefit, and generally hurt people in a variety of ways. That's why it's universally illegal, and open donation is allowed.","1272672293"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","here's the thing with that - unless you have a Real Doll that is going to stay the same shape, size, never be in a mood, never have wants other than yours, most guys will at some point be less attracted to their SO.  It will go up and down with moods, stress levels, and hormone levels.  Girls do this as well.  When someone CRAVES you, and they feel sexy themselves, it turns you on more than just looking at them and thinking ""do I want to have sex right now?"".  If she were comfortable with looking and acting sexy and then she craved an orgasm with him, I bet he would be turned on like he had just met her.  There is just something about maintaining a healthy attitude and working to keep each others mental state up.  If he shows her she's beautiful, and she shows him he's hot stuff to her, things work out a lot better.  In time he will fill his brain up with mental images of her reach for his cock out of desire and need, her toying herself, toying with him, etc.  I'm not saying he won't still use porn.  Pretty much everyone does that and that is COMPLETELY NORMAL.  Making it known and not feeling bad for it is a step in relaxing their minds as well.  Being relaxed about sex is KEY as you get older and are in a long term relationship.  If you don't feel judged or guilty you only look forward to it and it becomes playful.  It's hard to be attracted to someone who doesn't playfully reach for you or tease you visually or mentally.  It's even harder to be attracted to someone who judges you, makes you feel incapable, or makes you feel undesirable.","1272672299"

Yes.  ""Running your own cloud"" with redundancy, reliability, and security, is no simple task.  Nor is it cheap.  It takes scale to make cloud storage work.

&gt; I argue that there is every value for Google in this. [...]

Sorry, I didn't see anything in there about actual value for Google.  Yes, they have been pushing open standards for many things.  Yes, they have lots of talented engineers.  How does any of this make is valuable for them to interface with your cloud?  Google pushes open web standards because it makes their job easier.

However, allowing you to store your gmail on a different cloud service gives them nothing.  It reduces their lock-in.  It complicates their infrastructure.  It reduces customer confidence.  (Who will you blame when the service goes down?)  They get nothing in exchange for making the backend open.

Google likes open standards when openness helps them, and they love proprietary things when it doesn't.  We've never seen Google's ad server code, or their Map-Reduce implementation.

Maybe I am reading too much of the subtext, but to me this feels like a request for me to legitimize my right to complain.

&gt; You are a most interesting individual, do continue.

Thanks for the observation and the permission.

&gt; Anyway, in America, we would appreciate people who come here, in whatever way, respect our laws and our citizens. It is not happening in Arizona, so say 70% of the citizens there by supporting this new law.

Well professor, there are all kind of people in the world. This country has long benefited by the work that a servile brown skinned almost slave labor force has provided, they do things that most average Americans feels is beneath them. This work force is paid as little as possible because, guess what? The poor suckers can't complain so they ain't gonna tell anybody. So when their children or the less passive among them decide not to continue in their subservient roles they try to break out, but guess what? There are no opportunities out there for uppetty  beaners, the opportunities left to survive are crime and vice ( something no sane person could condone but, sane people can see the roots). You are seeing the classic result of exploitation, if you do  not believe just pick up a history book every once in a while (as watered down as they are you would still be surprised).  So 70% of the population are scared, there is a crime epidemic out there, it just so happens that there are a lot of brown faces among the criminals so in a case of ""post hoc ergo propter hoc"" ( after it therefore because of it, just in case you latin is rusty), they condemn the whole dammed race. Nice huh.
&gt; In a quick summary, why do think the citizens of Arizona should not be able to pass any law they want?

Because it is an ignorant law that converts their fears and their prejudices into a tool that can be used to hurt anybody that may be disliked because of xenophobic tendencies.   Because the people that lit the ovens in Auschwitz were obeying a law that was passed by people who though they were entitled to pass it.  

By this point I guess we are well passed the point where we should invoke Godwin's law.

Also, VerticalEvent's math is fine until he implies that 22.5% chance of a proc per tick means you'll get a proc about every 5 seconds. If OP is at the haste soft cap a ~20% chance would imply a proc on the order of about 10 seconds.

It was loud enough that everyone in the room turned at toward me at once. At first I tried to play it off but I knew everyone knew the source, so I tried to sputter something that was vaguely coherent and just ended with ""...yeah, I got nothing.""

The second time was even better. I went to a private Catholic high school that required all seniors to go on a religious retreat. I was not exactly enthusiastic as I was already beginning to embrace the atheist that I openly profess to be now. Anyway, during the last day of the retreat I had eaten an entire box of frosted mini-wheats as a snack and the fiber was doing a number on me. We were all gathered in a smallish room listening to a sermon one of the brothers was giving and he told us to all bow our heads for a silent prayer.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","&gt;No, but frukt seemed to feel the law banning veils was justifiable because it had been democratically selected.

Let's substitute a few words:

""No, but Testamint seemed to feel the law enforcing the veils was justifiable because it had been democratically selected.""

See the problem?  The veil is a product of a foreign law.  That law is called Sharia law.  The culture that gave rise to the Sharia law believes that women are men's chattel, and believes that it's a woman's responsibility to keep men from being aroused.  Therefore women must dress modestly according to Sharia law.  And if a woman wants to be *indisputably* modest, she then must cover all of herself.  Hence the veil.

This kind of Sharia bullshit is utterly antithetical to Western values.  It is completely incompatible.  So here you have two cultures with two laws:  Islamic culture with Sharia law and Western culture with our secular laws.  They are *not compatible*.  They are both a product of democracy (I'm being unbelievably charitable toward Islam here, because Islamic cultures tend to be brutal and undemocratic, but let's say the way they came around was democratic).  Which democracy will you side with?

Foreign-to-Belgium democracy and its products like the veil?  Or the native Belgium democracy?

And if you agree that a popular decision is not always moral, then you must agree that the veil and what it represents in an Islamic context is highly immoral.  So if you can ignore the popularity contest, why aren't you bashing the veil harder?  You seem very biased.","1272672435"
"WTF","t5_2qh61","Why are they asking the fucking weatherman for his opinion?

Anyway, besides using many illogical points, there is one idea there that is valid.

&gt;The researchers would take a single child out of the classroom for a nonverbal IQ test consisting of a series of puzzles -- puzzles easy enough that all the children would do fairly well. Once the child finished the test, the researchers told each student his score, then gave him a single line of praise. Randomly divided into groups, some were praised for their intelligence. They were told, ""You must be smart at this."" Other students were praised for their effort: ""You must have worked really hard."" ...

&gt;Then the students were given a choice of test for the second round. One choice
was a test that would be more difficult than the first, but the researchers told the kids that they'd learn a lot from attempting the puzzles. The other choice, Dweck's team explained, was an easy test, just like the first. Of those praised for their effort, 90 percent chose the harder set of puzzles. Of those praised for their intelligence, a majority chose the easy test. The ""smart"" kids took the cop-out.
Why did this happen? ""When we praise children for their intelligence,"" Dweck wrote in her study summary, ""we tell them that this is the name of the game: Look smart, don't risk making mistakes."" And that's what the fifth-graders had done: They'd chosen to look smart and avoid the risk of being embarrassed.

"politics","t5_2cneq","Gas companies raise prices whenever they fucking feel like it.

Remember our fake oil crisis, after W launched the war in Iraq? Gas went up to over $5/gallon out here in California.  There was no restriction on supply or production anywhere in the world;  we haven't used *any* Iraqi petroleum since the 1990s at the latest. There was no crisis; *there wasn't even a shortage.*

But the petroleum conglomerates knew you didn't know that. Even better for them, they knew even if you did know about their scam,  they could *still* charge you whatever they wanted per gallon. They raised the price because they *knew they could* and even better for them, they *knew* the oilmen in the White House *wouldn't raise a finger to rein them in.*

You'll notice that in the quarter after $5/gallon ""crisis,"" Exxon/Mobil posted the HIGHEST CORPORATE PROFIT *EVER* REPORTED IN THE HISTORY OF EARTH: $36 billion dollars. *Pure profit, one financial quarter.*

Americans REALLY need to pay attention to the political parties they favor.  Obama cut taxes for those making under $250,000/yr., and the loonies go into the street believing that he raised their taxes.

Exxon/Mobil *stole* hundreds, maybe thousands, out of the pocket of *every single driver* in America, and from every single non-driver too, as the trucking companies had to suddenly pay a 150% increase for fuel. But no one cares about that. No one's out in the street waving stupid misspelled signs screaming about that crime.

Before you vote, always ask yourself:  who *truly* represents *MY* interests? (ProTip: it ain't the Party that the petroleum corporations favor.)

Then there's the factors of geography and cultural limits: You're unlikely to see the offspring of an Inuit Eskimo and an Australian Aboriginal, for instance.

Given those restrictions, the probability of a code collision seems much less astronomical, especially since it's the probability of *any two humans who have ever existed* matching, not the probability of any human matching another specific human.

Instead of you sitting here writing on Reddit thinking that airlines would allow guns why don't you do this.

Write the airlines.  Ask them if they would allow citizens to carry guns on their flights.

You get one of them to say yes and you have something to work with.  

But you're not going to write them.

You're not going to do it for a couple of reasons.

One is it might take to much effort.

Another is you don't want the answer.  The answer will be no.  Actually it will be ""hell no"".  And if you get that answer it will fuck up your argument.  Because right now you have your boogy man.  It's the government taking away your rights.  But if you are told by the airlines that they won't do it either way then you can't blame the government anymore.  And you need that.

And then go ask around.  Go to the mall or something.  Ask people if that's what they want.  But you already know the answer to that one too.

Or how about this?  Why don't you learn to fly and buy your own plane and fly people around and let them bring their guns.  Isn't that the libertarian way?  If one business doesn't let you do something and you start a competing business that allows it you should succeed. 

There you go.

So now you have two things to do.

Write some letters.

And learn to fly and start your own airline.","1272672475"

To be honest, working for the public system required jumping through too many hoops. I also like the working schedule of the private system. You start in the late afternoon and finish up late evening. However, the drawback of the private system is that there is very little vacation time. If you only plan on doing it for a year, going without much vacation time isn't a big deal, but in the long-term you might want to go with the public system. 

As far as programs go my advice would be to forget about recruiters. I used a recruiter my first time around, and the second time around they were absolutely no help. When I applied to schools directly I received a more favourable response. I'm assuming it's because if they hire you they don't have to pay a recruiter a fee. I applied directly to a school and negotiated on my own. I would do the research to see what the industry standards are before taking on this task. Good luck!

No I think we should utilize the knowledge that we already have but discontinue our current forms of animal experimentation. To me torturing animals in the pursuit of knowledge is not acceptable. Here is an example of what I am talking about. 

The Nazis experimented on the Jews and made many medical discoveries that have saved countless lives. Does that mean that it was ethical of them to perform those horrific experiments? Should we continue these types of experiments? I think not. Should we disregard all of the knowledge that was gained from those experiments? No. So what is my point? We should use the knowledge that we have already obtained but abstain from those barbaric practices in the future. If there are no other methods available for scientific inquiry other than painful animal testing (I am OK with animal testing as long as no one gets hurt or killed) I think we should wait until there is.

You lost any credibility you may have had with me when you said that. I've been around dogs my whole life of all sorts of various breeds, my mom trained dogs and I have had several friends who were trainers. So in addition to all the research I've done for my own dog, I've had a lot of first hand experience.

Breed is a VERY important factor. Huskies for example need a lot of exercise, that's not an opinion, it's not a ""stereotype"", it's a firm hard fact. They have been breed to run and that also means they have a ton of energy which means they can be very destructive to your house if you aren't prepared for it.

Now let's take a look at a breed that's known for its aggression; pitbulls have had been breed to want to dominate all other dogs and they require lots of socialization with other dogs at a very early age. Where as a husky requires little to no effort at all.

This can be easily be observed by going to a dog park. Every pitbull I've seen has made an attempt to fight my dog and dominate him. Yet every time there's another wolfdog, or any spitz dog they're instantly best friends. Great danes are also very gentle and good with other dogs, even despite their size. You can't expect anyone to believe that all those pitbulls just happened to have horrible owners while all the spitz dogs had wonderful owners who socialized them early and often with other dogs.

From birth I've given my dog just as much socialization with people as I have with other dogs yet he's still very timid around strangers. He's great with other dogs and always has been. The collie I had however loved everybody and I did *zero* socialization training with that dog. I probably could have beat that dog daily and he would have still loved me and everybody he met.

Now I'm not saying it's impossible to make an aggressive dog friendly or turn a nice well adjusted family dog into a demon spawn of hell, but the amount of effort it will take depends greatly on that dog's breed.

When you sit there and tell a prospective dog owner ""breed just determines looks, it's attitude is based entirely on how you raise it."" you're just setting them up to fail. This is the exact type of thought process that puts dogs in the kennels in the first place. Owners get them not understanding the special needs of that breed and it ends up being more than they can handle and they dump it off at a pound.","1272672565"

* apple accuses people of stealing ideas (android) but look at their ipad!  There were many tablets out long before apple showed up to play. The hypocrisy bugs me.
* pricing on i products is way out of line and once the next big thing comes out, first buyers take a 200 dollar hit 2 months after a release. They don't make their products acceptable to the masses because of this.

It would be really nice if you could assign access to POSes individually and even if there were a few more user groups to assign access to than just Starbase Configure Dude, Starbase Fuel Operator, Corporation, and Alliance. If custom groups could be created and then populated, then alt-corps wouldn't need to be created within alliances just for some security-sake for enterprising individuals looking to throw up a POS but who are worried about another Starbase Configure Dude jacking their stuff. Obviously, there would be a lot of overhead involved with implementing such a system, but there has to be a better way.

2) Shares of corporations. I think that it is absurd for corporations to have to keep shares in the hands of one individual for security sake. The fact that if any amount of shares is given to more than one individual means that anyone can vote to issue more shares, give themselves those shares and then take control of the corporation if he knows that the other people with the shares are going to be away from the game for more than 24 hours is bullshit. Also, if there were separate classes of shares that would also be very nice and I don't think that it would be particularly hard to implement. There could be a class of shares that does not give any voting rights, for the purpose of dividends or anything carebearish like that (not my cup of tea, but don't see why it shouldn't be done). More relevant to our current position would be a class of shares that would be allowed to vote on anything, except for new CEOs or issuance of shares. And then of course a class of shares held by the CEO (or others) that can vote on new share issuance and CEO elections.","1272672596"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Yeah, I'm gonna go right ahead and say that it's different in Canada than it is in the states.

I'm serious. Racism is the status quo down there. Something so simple as me offering the seat next to me to a black man in the states got me a ""are you freaking crazy?"" look from him, and he went and sat down next to a Latina woman.

I've heard another story where the details are really fuzzy, but I just remember the story of a white guy visiting from Canada trying to interact with a black man at work on a more social level, and the black man started to get really aggressive - again, fuzzy details, but something that he was trying to offer him the guy was taking offense to, thinking it was about race - wondering WTF was wrong with him, until a (black) friend of his pulls him back, says ""No man, he wasn't trying to pull anything on you. He's from Canada. It's different up there."" Again, the details are really fuzzy but I remember that it's something that nobody really thinks twice about here because race generally isn't a huge issue.

Only real racism I see in Canada is limited to people being angered towards immigrants who don't know local customs and there's still a lot of racism problems towards first nations. But I see cross-race relationships all the time. I'm white and my best friend is Persian - was born in Tehran. There is still racism but it's generally considered taboo and is nowhere near the status quo. I love living in a country that defines itself as ""multicultural.""","1272672611"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I wouldn't know.  I gave up on home wireless routers quite some time ago.  I just hung an old desktop running pfSense off the cable modem.  Then I hung a cheap switch off of that, and a old Netgear wireless router with the DHCP turned off off of the switch. 

It's kinda mickey-mouse, but it handles everything I throw at it.  There isn't a torrent made that'll knock it over.  The radio hangs in the Netgear from interference maybe twice a month, I just unplug and replug it and that takes care of it.  On the wired side, nothing ever dies.

Home routers just seem kinda underpowered and buggy to me.  They're ok for casual use, but they won't take any kind of a heavy load.  The only exception might be a Linksys WRT54G, as long as it's V4 or under, with a third-party firmware like Tomato or something.  

They still make the V4, only it's called WRT54GL, for (L)inux.  Avoid Version 5 and up like the plague.  They chopped the Flash ROM and RAM Memory in half.  I got stuck with one of those, and they're suitable for a paperweight and little else.  I offed it on my nephew-in-law.  Sucker.  Hehehe...

"electronics","t5_2qhue","based on the description you provided, you might be screwed.  VGA is essentially an RGB input with timing, red, green, and blue lines.   DVI is digital signals.  the composite signal combines all the signal into one line, so it is fundamentally incompatible with VGA/DVI unless made compatible through a converter box.

by the way, the single yellow line is called composite RCA, not component.  

However, according to wikipedia, the Gamecube Model DOL-001 has a component output (3 lines - YPbPr signals / Green - Blue - Red colored cable respectively).  Build this [circuit](http://web.archive.org/web/20070303095454/http://home.att.net/~billhudson/rybyrgb.pdf) (warning - PDF hosted at archive.org) and you can convert the component to RGB, which is incidentally what the VGA on your monitor needs to see.

I have used it almost every day since I received it and [still use it to this day](http://imgur.com/JF0hb.jpg). I LOVE it, the paint is coming off of it, the feet are all but gone... but I just can't seem to find anything to replace it that has the same weight/feel. 


Unfortunately, for the last few months, the batteries have been going dead on it. Before you ask, yes, I am still using the same rechargeable batteries that came with it! I can't seem to find any batteries that fit the specs of the stock ones online... they all are rated too high! I think the rechargeable batteries of the 2003 era were just a bit weaker than today's batteries. Any ideas?

Oh yeah... not that it's under warranty, but I'm in the states... Kentucky. I feel like that guy with the Toyota that just passed up 500,000 miles and can't let his baby go. I actually have the keyboard that goes with this thing, but it has seen it's last leg a year or two ago. Every now and then, I will pull it out of the closet, hook it up and it will work... then it will die on me after a day or (2).

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","Oh-- I gotcha. 
So it is typically understood in contemporary anthro/sociology to distinguish among the categories of race, ethnicity, nationality, etc. 

Ethnicity is usually understood has one's current or ancestral heritage. So, I am Chinese and Italian. These words reference specific cultures and locations. 

Nationality typically refers to the place you were born. So, for me. US American. 

Race... yeah it is tricky to summarize because the meaning of it is rather fluid. Obviously you know the terms white, black, brown, and so on... these are races. When used very generally-- Latino or Asian can be used as races as well but this is only in general terms. They are non-specific to country or culture. They more or less are meant to describe a group of people based on certain (emphasis on certain because we could choose to group people by many different factors... skin color is the most common) physical characteristics who may or may not be of the same ethnicity or nationality. So... I consider myself to be half white but the white part of me doesn't reference what white might mean to you. 

Similarly the distinction is made between sex and gender. I think this distinction is analogous to race and ethnicity. Sex-- biologically determined and referencing. Gender--social construction of what it means to be a man or a woman. Again... what it means to be a woman and a man (but really more woman) is in constant social shift. Think of the change in what has been considered ""acceptable behavior"" for women... ever-changing.

HDR is ok if not overblown, which I think yours are personally.

The digital camera sensor has it's limitations when it comes to dynamic range, I use HDR to try and get as close as possible to what the eye sees, the eye has a much higher dynamic range.

Someone gave me a good tip, they said take the HDR version of the photo and add it as a layer on top of the original in photoshop and lower the HDR layer opacity to roughy 50%, I use 45&amp; in the example below.

The HDR image is the top one in case you didn't notice and the bottom one is the original photograph. You will notice subtle differences between the 2, particularly the refection and the saturation.

The number one rule of HDR is don't overdo it.

However rules are made to be broken! ;-)

He would still have diplomatic immunity and the consulate would still be on what amounts to Chinese soil.  In this case it would be the US using US law to deal with someone (using your example of a child being hit by a car) in Saudi Arabia the Saudis could use the same reasoning to detain US consular staff for breaching local laws that seem far less sensible...  The reason for diplomatic immunity and the status given to consulates and embassies is to ensure that you don't have tit for tat harassment of diplomats and so that countries can communicate sensibly with one another, it isn't about US law or what is right given a certain act, it is the principle of the thing.  In this case the police officers involved should have known better and were utterly in the wrong.

&gt;Fleeing the cops is fleeing the cops.

Diplomatic immunity is diplomatic immunity and US law doesn't apply to Chinese soil, whether in China or within the borders of the US.","1272672810"

To me it the same kind of bittersweet joy that comes from buying a one-off or limited-time-only beer, sampling something similar at a beer event, or encountering something unique while traveling. When you know that no matter how much you like it, you are probably not gonna get another chance to drink it, so enjoy it now!  

When i lived out East I was not into Brooklyn's beers because the first ones I was introduced to were very underwhelming (lager, pilsner, Pennant '55 ale, brown ale).  But I sampled some of their Local #1 at a festival and I immediately threw aside my premature judgment of their beers.  I really liked the Local #1 and was curious to try a few of their others, but I could only get the basic lineup in Florida. 

I had the same problem with Bell's.  The only beers of theirs that were available were not very impressive (Oberon was the only one that interested me at all and it isn't even that good).  I couldn't get any of their highly acclaimed brews like Two-hearted.

I can't wait for that collabo between HOTD and Deschutes.  Those are two of my favorites right there.  I just wish HOTD weren't so damn expensive.  I balked at paying $6/12oz bottle for Fred the other day.  That just hurts my wallet too much.","1272672855"

Furthermore, the government gives the banks the money to perform these functions. In the past, the banks would have to manually evaluate who to give money to. Now the banks allocate the money algorithmically. The government could easily allocate loans and investment to various sectors of the economy at a vastly reduced price with the exact same formulas that the banks use without much of the risk or insane payscale, leaving more room in the economy for real growth in your all-important 401ks. As a bonus, this investment could then be democratically controlled.

When I joined my latest gym, I noted they didn't have a lot of the same equipment as my previous gym and didn't really know what to do.  I took the 1 free session which was half a waste of time and half really helpful.  (The first half was an ""assessment"").  But, I learned a whole bunch of stuff in that last half an hour and bought some sessions.  

I loved them.  My trainer was really knowledgeable and I tested what he was telling my by reading all I could about fitness...everything he was teaching me seemed to be on par with what I was reading so I was confident in what I was learning.


I think the personality of your trainer is important though - I like my trainer and his approach - it works for me.  When the sessions were over, I was a bit sad, actually.

Not everyone has the best experience but test the knowledge on the first session afterward and see if it's a good personality match.","1272672911"

"programming","t5_2fwo","You're thinking in the wrong terms - we haven't moved onto newer, better technology; all this is doing is restricting access to the fundamentals of that technology, restricting the 'tinkering' to an abstract layer on top of the same hardware, hardware that you don't have physical access to (the cloud) and hardware you don't have legal access to (the device).  

We wouldn't have a computer industry if this had been considered acceptable 30 years ago. Well, I tell a lie - in fact, this is a return to the old 'big iron' mainframes of old, and they were considered monolithic and flawed precisely because they weren't able to keep up with the new, open, multipurpose systems. Cloud computing is fundamentally dangerous because, while you decentralise your data, you centralise control of that data to a few companies with the infrastructure or money to maintain decentralised cloud services.

I want to see computers and computing continue to evolve, and for that to happen it is absolutely vital that we have generations of engineers and programmers who are familiar with computing from the lowest hardware level to the most abstract 'high' level, who are allowed to tinker with their devices, who are not fenced in to some virtualised, safe AppEngine play-area. Computing is a wide, varying landscape and we have access to all of it, currently. My greatest fear is that this landscape will be fenced off, leaving only those in the employ of some companies able to even view parts of it. The reason that this isn't sustainable is that the engineers and programmers that create and innovate in our industry started learning all this stuff on their own computers, by exploring them completely. Linus Torvalds wouldn't have been able to create Linux if all he had were devices so locked-down that he couldn't get them to run another OS, for example.","1272672950"

Building like a tank is also easier.  More forgiving to mistakes and the game is more fun the less you die.  It's a more noob friendly build.

Most people also think he's a tank at first glance(can you blame them?) so that's how they build him when they first play him.  Some people don't learn and most stop playing a hero after a couple games unless they really like him.  This is why you see more Mundo tank builds when he's free.

Picking good item builds is one of the hardest parts of the game (unless you just steal them).  Some people never learn, and others just haven't played enough games.  Without help it takes at least 10-20 games with a character to fully understand how to build him.  This is why so many people recommend going to Leaguecraft.com and other places for item builds.

"programming","t5_2fwo","The funny thing about Fermat's last theorem is that it is easy to explain why it must be true, but a real bitch to prove.

For powers greater than 2, the spacing between x^n for adjacent integers is more than twice the lower value to the nth power.  In other words a^n + b^n = c^n, won't work because x^n grows faster than 2x^n.  Pick a particular value for c.  When you try to solve for a and b, the biggest value you can get that doesn't exceed c^n is obtained by picking (c-1)^n twice.  When n&gt;2, (c-1)^n + (c-1)^n &lt; c^n.  Think about it for n=3.  If you pick c=4, then c^3=64.  The biggest result you can get for a and b that doesn't exceed 64 is found at 3^3 + 3^3 = 54.    As you pick larger values of n, the spacing between consecutive x^n grows even faster.

The reason this can't be shown with simple algebra is because that is not true for n=1 and n=2.  We can prove Fermat's holds for a particular n&gt;2, but not easily for a generic n due to these counter-examples.  I spent quite a bit of time as a kid trying to prove the theorem by induction (assume it is true for n, prove it is true for n+1).  I am not happy with Wiles' general proof because it is so complicated for something that seems so intuitive, but I concede that the algebraic proof is beyond me.","1272672994"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","""Just be yourself"" = biggest horseshit advice for getting chicks ever.

You're always yourself. All that means is - don't step outside your scruples. Don't do things that are genuinely wrong.

""Just be confident"" = only slightly better. The problem is, what if you have no confidence.

""Feign confidence until it comes naturally"" is probably the best advice I can give you. If you can't be confident, just fake it. It's not like you're going to be exposed to be a fraud because you're faking confidence. If anything, people finding that out after you've been faking it would make them respect you even MORE, because... wow, you can be that confident while on the inside you're nervous as hell? That's impressive!

Don't get so caught up in ""preserving"" respect for other people you deal with that you don't save any for yourself. Make them work for your respect. Respect yourself first, then respect those who deserve it.

So yeah. Fake it. At first it'll feel weird, but eventually you'll get used to it and it'll come naturally.

Being yourself is just a matter of knowing what you like to do, what you want to do, and being true to that. Just be wary of that at all times with all decisions you make. Also know that YOU can be whoever you WANT to be.

So... who do you WANT to be?

Now start taking steps to be that person. Eventually you'll find you are that person.","1272673050"

"science","t5_mouw","They can't  know how long a particular individual's life might be extended. The estimate is an average extrapolated from the results of a trial population taking the drug. A study population takes the drug. Then they look at how long they live and compare it to another group that doesn't get the drug. If, on average, those in the group taking the drug live 4 months longer, one can use that figure as a measure of its efficacy.

It doesn't mean that if you get prostate cancer and your doctor estimates you have 6 months to live that you could take this drug and live 10 months. You might take the drug and only live 2 months, not even reaching the 6 month estimate, or take the drug and live 2 years after the diagnosis. 

The estimate is based on statistics. That's what insurance companies use when deciding what rates to charge for health, auto, or home insurance.

As a comparison of Provenge's potential benefit, the standard treatment for men whose prostate tumors don't respond to hormone therapies helps patients live about 2.4 months longer. So Provenge does appear to be somewhat better than the current standard treatment - see [	FDA approves $93K prostate cancer vaccine](http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2010-04-30-prostatevaccine30_ST_N.htm),","1272673083"

"programming","t5_2fwo","Can we let the car analogy just die please.

The car is nothing like a computer.

Cars have a fixed, very narrow field of functions they must perform (transport people and goods from A to B). Those didn't change at all since they were first invented. Computers have a virtually unlimited number of functions they can perform and most of them probably changed since or weren't even invented when you bought your current computer.

Cars are extremely dangerous to the public in the hands of untrained drivers and both their operation and repair is thus highly regulated compared to most other devices. Computers on the other hand don't even have a formal education associated with their repair, essentially people repairing computers are all self-taught and doing fine.

Cars use mainly parts large enough to disassemble or even create by hand, computers need large factories with special clean room environments to build them at the current quality level at all. Whole boards are usually exchanged because of a single fault in one chip, even on reasonably open systems, because with its millions of microscopic components finding the faulty one would be close to impossible. Software on the other hand can even be written by a complete layman without worrying about damaging their computer, something that can't be said about any component of a car.

Any kind of new car design requires a huge staff of hundreds of people (if not more), designing new functions for your computer can be (and is being) done by software developing teenagers on their home computer.

If you really think a few completely closed companies could develop a software ecosystem that is even half as attractive to the user as the current open one then you are very deluded and quite frankly stuck in the 80s when this was actually done. Sure, the average user only uses half a dozen programs, email, a web browser, video and audio players and one or two others, those one or two others are different for every user though and you could never get most people to give them up in favor of a completely closed system which would only allow those first four mentioned above.","1272673146"

i would say maybe 10% of the day is actually involved with students.  i found standing in the hall in between periods is actually helpful as i get more student contact during that 7 minutes than any other time

i am currently pursuing my plc, but struggling to find private clients.

i became a school counselor after wanting to work with a lot of studnets and to be directly involved with their education and how to improve their issues if any.  it is billed as a way to be involved with their academics and to help those who may struggle.  most of my time is talking with parents complaining about poor grades and blaming teachers, not so much that their students don't study.

pay isn't too bad and the benefits are great.  i am using the public service forgiveness loan to pay off all my debts in 10 years as the government forgives whatever is left after 120 payments.  i have mentioned this program several times on here, but to nothing but downvotes.

I suppose the best way to work out math is utilising logic and your algebra skills. As explained by Enbaros, you first solve for ""x"" using the equation given: 

    (2x-5)(2x+5) = 5
    Multiply the polynomial out and solve for ""x"":
        4(x^2) - 25 = 5
        4(x^2) = 30
        x^2 = 15/2
        x = ± (15/2)^(1/2)
    From here forth, you plug your value for ""x"" to receive what you're looking for:
        4[(15/2)^(1/2)]^(2)
        = 4(15/2)
        = 30

The truth is, no matter how much you think you've given up, if the right opportunity comes along, you'll probably find that you're still interested - and in the intervening time you won't be making your life miserable by defining success as something that you can't currently have.

Give up in the sense that you stop consciously pursuing it.  If you instead spend your efforts on other things - more certain things like learning new skills, widening your horizons, pursuing some long-held dream - things that through effort you can be more sure of gaining satisfaction from - then you'll be a lot happier.

"gaming","t5_2qh03","Nice analysis.  I agree with you.  The problem with Halo and CoD is that so much game budget is sunk into producing new art assets and other frills, that not enough budget goes to hiring and employing good game designers and AI programmers who will change the game in compelling ways.  I would also not be surprised if some of the game companies are too top heavy for what they need to be.  Game companies should have extremely flat management structure, even if said company is 100 employee strong.

So I guess what I said should be amended to ""If are a mature company *and you can afford it*, you should focus on refinements.""  The key is to actually have these refinements though.  I would argue that COD and Halo are void of refinements.  A refinement is like a mini-innovation rather than a barely noticeable touch-up.  Well, I think COD MW2 actually had mini-innovations, but they went backward in that instead of adding to gameplay they subtracted from it.","1272673387"

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt;Are you stupid. They are by law required to pay for everything. But exxon still hasn't paid for everything from their sill. So it's a joke to think these people will pay for it.

No, they normally get sued and fight it, which is why I assumed you were saying ""companies don't care about lawsuits""...because they normally get the amounts knocked down.

Once they admit responsibility publicy, it's nearly impossible to back away from that. You are expecting them to pay pre-emptively, and assuming they won't pay when both they and the whitehouse said they would without question. You have absolutely no evidence to support what you say, and the courts would certainly force them to given their accepting of responsibiltiy anyways. They're in damage control mode.

&gt;This one was. They completely ignored safety, new technology, and were not prepared at all for this scenario. The ""worst case scenario"" they said they prepared for to the government was something not even close to what happen. They lied. And then they also lied about the amount of oil leaking. They said it was 1k gallons a day. The user government checked it out and found out it was really 5k gallons a day. Either BP is lying or is grossley incompetent.

Yeah, because no one revises estimates that are given in emergency situations. Yet again, you have no proof or even evidence of what you say, but your anger leads you to a conclusion.

&gt;That is malicious.

Not when it's in their financial best interests to prevent things like that. And if they actually have to pay what it's looking like they will, it would most definitely be that.

&gt;Yes I can. Since regulations mean fines before accidents happen. And they can shut operations down if they don't fix problems.
Lawsuits = after the fact. Regulations = before the fact = prevention. Got it? Very simple.

No, because you're wrong. They have to sue them under a previously existing regulatory policy. Lawsuits and Fines=Enforcing regulations.

You're in no position to be calling anyone else ""stupid"" if you don't even understand how the policies you advocate work. Generally the way it works is that bills give a regulatory agency authority over a certain topic, and give them certain restrictions to impose/scope of mission. The regulatory agency then has rulemaking authority within those constraints. The commission votes on these, and if they're passed they become the standard of the industry. 

If you violate these rules (or the original law that gave them the power), **you get sued by the government**. This is why the SEC is suing Goldman Sachs, and why the FTC sued places for negative option billing and deceptive advertising. They're regulations that are already in place and enforced by lawsuit.


&gt;Then you went back to lying. Do you work for BP?

No, I just don't think it's *possible* for them to keep offshore drilling safe enough to not damage other industries, and I think the oceans are a community resource. No matter what they do/don't do, there will too good of a chance that something will go wrong. There's no way to see everything coming, and it's not worth the risk.","1272673408"

Answer: ship smokes over for sale for under $20 a pack.  The cost at which said entrepreneur can acquire &amp; transport said smokes vs the price of smokes on AU shelves determine how viable the business is.

Aim-Assist is where you are close so it moves you just a bit over so you are on target, the best ones are where you don't really notice the jump.  
Auto-Aim is where you hit a button and the cross hairs jump to a target.

Those are the definitions that I've always used but I think that sometime devs get cute and call auto-aim aim-assist I believe COD does this, I think they are trying to hide the fact that it aim-assist exists, and it basically has to because of the dead zone on all game pads*.

Anyone could write a book, anyone could wait a table, anyone could do any type of thing but what is different is your ability to do said thing and people who do things better than other people like say people who write books better or wait tables better or vlog better get more money than people who do those things worse.  Is Leo Laporte just talking into a camera?  The young turks, just talking into a camera?  Rush Limbaugh just talking into a camera?  

The current method to make money, and that's what the op was talking about making money by vlogging since he specifically said ""people are trying to make money by contributing to a medium that's dependant on tips!"" so the focus here is how people are compensated, do not confuse this with everyone who vlogs is compensated they obviously aren't but that's totally irrelevant here, no one is talking about people who aren't compensated we are talking about people who ARE compensated and the main way that happens is through tipping!

Vlogging isn't anything by default anymore than anything else is something by default, fixing computers for me is a hobby that I do for free and I could most certainly charge a good amount of money doing it but it is something I enjoy doing so I choose not to charge money for it and that's the exact same thing with some people who vlog, some people would like to be compensated and the current payment scheme seems to be tipping!  As you stated before there isn't any ""record deal"" awaiting vloggers and some people are very good at what they do and are so good people are willing to compensate them and as we have gone over many times now this is how it is done.

So to make it very simple for you the line ""Isn't it terrible? People are trying to make money by contributing to a medium that's dependent on tips!"" is a sarcastic one which illustrates that for people who want to be compensated for their vlogging the way for this to occur is through tipping and it is ironic that people do not understand that this is the way that those people are compensated because they are bitching about it as if that isn't how you are compensated for vlogging as you noted before with your ""there is no record deal awaiting vloggers"" comment which demonstrates your obvious understanding that there isn't many ways to get paid for vlogging.

Personally I think the whole tipping system we have in the US is retarded and I would do away with it completely, I actually think someone who works at McDonalds deserves more of a tip than the person working in a typical restaurant, pretty much anytime you walk into a McDonalds those people are constantly doing something non stop and they are making pretty close to min wage while a waitress/waiter can do much better than that.  I don't get to make the rules though.

However, the show did not initially reveal its **fictional** nature to its audience. After the fictional status of the show was revealed in September 2006, it gradually evolved into a multi-character series including both character videoblogs and action sequences, with a complex story universe involving ""trait positive girls"" who are sought by an evil organization called ""The Order"".

One day I was sitting at the kitchen table eating a bowl of cereal, my housemate was sleeping or whatever, and his girlfriend was in the kitchen washing some dishes or something, and the morning sun gradually started shining into the kitchen window and I looked up and suddenly noticed the sunlight was absolutely penetrating the thin little nightdress she was wearing, and she was naked underneath the thing. The inside of her nightdress was just lit up and almost seemed to disappear.

I tried not to stare, I was like, wow. She has such a hot little body.

What was horrible is that she was fucking him and not me.","1272673468"

Meiji Shrine is a must.  Odaiba is fun if you're interested in shopping, the Toyota museum/showroom/concept cars/design showcase, and a mini Statue of Liberty.  Please go to Senso-ji Temple.  You could skip the Sony building but if you're in Ginza you'll be close by.  Shinjuku was really cool, as was Harajuku.

The food is incredible in Tokyo, be it Japanese or otherwise.  *Lunch set meals are the best deal you'll find anywhere in any big city*.  Eat pork tonkatsu at Maisen.  Eat sushi at a sushi-go-round restaurant.  Try Jackpot restaurant in Ebisu.  Go to the Tokyo Foodshow at Shibuya station.

Get the Pimsleur Japanese course (5 or 8 lessons) and you will be able to say a few important words by the time you fly.

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt;I'm not sure what you mean by interpretation. The Constitution isn't a vague document filled with metaphor, like the Bible. Could you clarify where interpretation comes into play here?

Libertarians have this strange idea that the Constitution is an inherently Libertarian document. I find this strange since libertarianism as a political ideology didn't surface until the twentieth century, over a Century after the Constitution was written, and many centuries following the authoring of many of the philosophies that the Constitution is based on. (I wouldn't call Locke, Hobbes, Montesquieu, or Paine libertarian, even if their works influenced modern libertarians). 

And yes, it really is. The Constitution is intentionally vague, and we've been arguing over exactly what it means since approximately ten minutes after the first draft was written. 

And, this may be taboo, but I feel that the Constitution is an inherently flawed document, whose flaws are responsible for much of the corruption, power consolidation and electoral issues in our country. I feel that our polar, ridiculous two party system is completely the fault of the Constitution itself... a flaw in the document that has ruined modern government. But that's another argument for another time.","1272673475"

Now it's my turn to criticize analogies: Are you saying oil *spoils* like a sandwich does, or that we are in danger of dying without drilling this specific resource?

&gt;  So let's drill it and store it. Sounds great.

I'd wager it's cheaper to store it where it is. 

&gt; Besides, only the craziest individual will demonize profit.

Gee, *thanks*... It's not ""demonizing"" profit, it's about pointing out that the majority of the value from opening it up will be captured by the extractive industry rather than to the taxpayer or to oil-consumers.

&gt; And yes, it will make a dent in the price. When supply goes up demand goes down, thus prices decrease - I'm not sure what kind of proto-Keynesian economic theory you're following, but it doesn't make sense to me.

I said **appreciable** dent. And for your information I'm following the frick'n government statistics... and the fact that OPEC can nullify any pricing changes and it may be in their best interest to do so.  
http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/servicerpt/anwr/

Read it.
&gt; Relative to the AEO2008 reference case, ANWR oil production is projected to have its largest oil price reduction impacts as follows: a reduction in low-sulfur, light (LSL) crude oil prices of **$0.41 per barrel** (2006 dollars) in 2026 in the low oil resource case, **$0.75 per barrel** in 2025 in the mean oil resource case, and **$1.44 per barrel** in 2027 in the high oil resource case.  

&gt; Assuming that world oil markets continue to work as they do today, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) could neutralize any potential price impact of ANWR oil production by reducing its oil exports by an equal amount.

At this moment the cost per barrel is about $86. I have no idea what it'll be in 2025, but I'm pretty sure it'll be higher. So taking 75 cents off of that is a **miniscule** price difference for consumers by the time production **finally** ramps up.","1272673557"

"politics","t5_2cneq","To begin with, it is the same old, same old.  Read the Arizona Employer Sanctions Law from January 1, 2008.  Also, the Federal Immigration and Reform Act of 1986 is relevant since everything in this new Arizona statute regarding employers just restates what those two laws have already established. Again...nothing new.

You say the law doesn't ""target citizens."" But that's just blatantly wrong: read the text of the bill, it specifically grants a police officer the right to search, seize, and detain private citizens under ""reasonable suspicion"" of them being an illegal immigrant, but it does not grant the same rights to police officers to search, seize, or detain documents from employers.  Yes, reasonable suspicion is a well established legal concept. In fact, it allows a police officer to search and detain an individual if he has a suspicion that a person ""has been, is, or is about to be engaged in criminal activity."" As you've said before, the biggest suspects for illegal immigration in Arizona are Mexican Americans. Thus, any cop could say that any Mexican-looking individual is reasonably suspicious of being an illegal immigrant, maybe because of his accent or his appearance.  This is the same legal concept that allows border guards to search your car when crossing the border, and now they are allowed to search your person if they suspect you might be guilty of being an illegal immigrant.

As of today, almost every single reported case of the use of this law in effect has been against a Mexican-American or citizen of Hispanic descent.  These people are citizens, people with just as much rights as you or I do. Until the day I see any person other than an individual of Hispanic descent arrested under this law, it is obviously meant to implicitly target people of Mexican descent, as does the [most recent law passed by Jan Brewer and the Arizona State Legislature](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/04/30/arizona-ethnic-studies-cl_n_558731.html)  To suggest that innocent Mexican American citizens will not be the subject of abuse by this law is incredibly naive.

As to your later comments, I'm actually a proud Japanese and Russian American who still gets called a ""gook"" by the occasional racist asshole. I didn't need to check those boxes on my SATs, but there's a damn good reason why they are there - if you actually did have any conception of what it means to be a minority in this country, you'd understand that.  Its hard not to be condescending to someone as ignorant and naive of the racial inequalities in this country as yourself. I don't give a fuck what racial mix you are - you are clearly either a self-hating racist or just living in a fantasy world in which racial inequalities and social injustices are silly lies told to you by the liberal media. Wake the fuck up - you're 1/4 mexican and, what is it, 1/64 Cherokee to still get benefits? are you fucking kidding me? you probably look as mexican as Vin Diesel - don't go spouting off to me about how you know what its like ""in the real world."" you're the fucking median in this racially diverse country. don't think you can pull that ""i'm 1/4 mexican so I can bash on those proud mexican"" bullshit with me.","1272673621"

No. Should I have demonstrated in neon lights that these statistics were being provided to support the statement I was responding to? **Jesus Christ, apparently**.

&gt;You might want to take a gander at the headline of the article.

I'm fully aware of what the headline was. But I wasn't responding to the headline. *Once again*, I was amplifying a statement that contradicted the implication in the headline. *How many times do I have to repeat this?*

&gt;This is the part where you apologize for being a fucking dumbass and/or a troll.

No, this would be the part where you realize that you have gone on a  bizarre crusade against someone for nothing more than citing some god damned numbers.","1272673635"

I have no problem with games that fit in to multiple genres. I think really I have a problem with side scroller being a genre. Either the games inside the genre are constrained to being games such as Mario, Double Dragon and Trials HD, games that have linear or almost linear progression entirely from a fixed 2D perspective. Or the genre is so large and diverse in itself that it feels almost pointless to use the label at all.

Consider the early 1990s, the emergence of the Internet into public consciousness. ISPs started popping up and people started getting 'online' with their windows 3.1 and windows 95 machines.

The reason the Internet took off is because people could run third-party programs without approval on their reasonably open systems. They could add unapproved modems. And they did.

But Microsoft didn't really 'get' the internet, and didn't consider it important. Consider if Microsoft had only permitted their approved applications onto Windows systems? Would millions of people have been able to install Netscape or Mosaic? Would they have had to wait until MS got round to recognising the net as important? Would the net have taken off publicly in such a big way if people were hamstrung by Microsoft and had to wait for it to finally notice? Given Microsoft's initial aggressive stance against the net, would they have tried, instead, to squash it?


The point is that we just don't know what the 'next big thing,' the next technological leap in computing might be, it might not even be internet-related. If we leave the open pastures of open, multipurpose computing behind and, instead, the majority of computing devices become dumb terminals, locked down (like the iPhone and iPad), then we will never know what that next big computing thing could be. It won't emerge and spread like wildfire as the internet did, because there won't be enough fertile soil (open systems) to feed it during its conception.","1272673735"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","This is something I've written about a fair amount in my writing career so far; this is an excerpt from a piece called **'Disposable Passions'** that I feel is relevant (maybe a tad long):

&gt;It’s never been enough for me to settle with what I have, but I don’t mean that in a material sense. I don’t care if I have the slowest car on the block or I live in the worst house on the street; I don’t mind how my food tastes or what my clothes look like; I don’t even care about how much money I have. But my reputation, the way others perceive me, my calling card to the world, that has never been good enough. 

&gt;When I meet people I want them to fall in love with me, I want to bond with them on a level where they know I am a great human being, that I’d never fuck them over or use them just for my own gains. That they know in any relationship I form I have exactly the right amount of sense when to look out for myself and when to look out for them. 

&gt;I can’t be second best at this; I can’t be told I’m a bad person. It’s my primary interest, my biggest hobby, my only passion. Not to be shallow or full of false pride but to genuinely connect with people in a way that they never knew possible. To know that meeting me could only have been for the better in life. 

&gt;But more than what strangers think, more than what business partners, colleagues or any teacher has ever perceived of me, I need to be the best for my friends; my surrogate family. I need to know that out of anybody they’ve ever met, out of anyone in our circle, that I’m the unbreakable part of the chain. If they had to pick one person, for whatever reason, that they would pick me, because they know I’ll always be there.

&gt;...

&gt;When looking back it is difficult not to be cynical about how things turned out. I’m close to my friends but they’re not my family. And my ‘family’ is not a family but a group of people that share a residence. Everybody has a sense of wanting to belong, to be someone special – to someone, somewhere, and after a while your friends can’t provide what you’re looking for. There’s a deeper urge, something more primal, more instinctive, that can only be fulfilled in a loving, sexual relationship. 
I don’t know if it’s biological, evolutionary, or something more complicated than that, but you will never connect with a friend in the same way you will connect with a lover. It makes sense because that’s how the world works, couples marry, live together, stay monogamous. But you think about all the friends you have lost, or are losing to their respective lovers, and you feel betrayed. She could never understand him like you do. You had been there longer. You saw him first.

&gt;But the truth is you want the same. And good lovers are rarer than good friends.

&gt;So good friends become disposable. ","1272673751"

We'll start with basic evolution proven, in labs, using basic DNA tests based on same alleles between parents and children.

This is combined with natural selection, which is proven by [e. coli long term evolution experiment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._coli_long-term_evolution_experiment) and field studies like the analysis of anti-biotic resistant bacteria, a specific example being antibiotic resistant malaria and [the peppered moth experiment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peppered_moth_evolution)

Applying these principles historically, you end up with phylogeny.  Phylogeny is proven by the fossil record.

The fossil record is proven by radiometric dating which has been proven time and time again to be an accurate method of dating through dating man made objects of antiquity and more recent items.  When tested, the layers of fossil record show consistent dating for various periods and offer a general progression of life on the planet.

The quickest proof of evolution is the fact that organisms fitting specific phylum appear only after benchmarks, like archaeotyrx lithographica marked the beginning point of modern birds as we know them showing up in the fossil record, there were no modern birds prior that have been discovered.  That specific fossil had morphological traits that linked it with sauropods, specifically maniraptora and Ornithomimus.  That new groups of organisms arise only after the breaking point of ancestors with obvious links (in this case, skeletal structure) to previous groups proves evolution.

Even without specific examples, the oldest layer of the fossil record has only simple organisms.  More complex organisms arise only later in the fossil record.  This would suggest that these simple organisms eventually evolved into the more complex ones and is consistent with most accepted hypothesis of abiogenesis rather than the biblical account of various categories of animal (including ladybugs, birds, bats, and pterodactyls) all being created on the same day.

As per human evoution, the Omo Remains, which are the oldest homo sapiens fossil and date back 200,0000 years (a good bit more than 6,000 no?) have morphological traits that tie them together with homo Heidelbergensis, specifically in terms of skull shape and hip posture (amongst less notable differences).  The reason that they are tied rather than incidental is that they share too many other similar traits to not be related.

**Sublimation** is the transition of a substance from the solid phase to the gas phase without undergoing intermediate liquification.

**Water**

Snow and ice sublimate, although more slowly, below the melting point temperature. This phenomenon is used in freeze drying, by hanging wet cloth outdoors in freezing weather to be retrieved dry at a later time. The loss of snow from a snowfield during a cold spell is often caused by sunshine acting directly on the outer layers of the snow.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","So the talk about Oceans under Europa and Enceladus have been going on for a few years now. Most have the general consensus that there is water underneath the surface, given the river like geysers that we know has organic molecules and water. However, the possibility of finding single celled life is very very slim (due to low energies), and the possibility of finding multicellular life is pretty much 0. So they suspect that single celled life may be possible due to tidal friction between Jupiter and the moon or hydrothermal vents underneath, both giving a supply of energy. However, finding complex life, in my opinion, will not happen. In many of the biology classes they teach that life started out unicelluar, then came the oxygen revolution, then a little bit later multicellular organisms arose. The importance of oxygen is it allowed a second form of respiration to occur, giving a lot more energy and thus ability to form more complex organisms. These two moons do not have oxygen easily available. 


So in short if you want to find multicellular life you need to look for oxygen signatures. There is currently a satellite that is looking at exoplanets for the Oxygen signature, when they find it, you better be damn excited that we may have found very complex aliens. However, I don't believe they will be smart enough to phone home.","1272673819"

BTW, OP, your parents suck.  If any of my kids is gay, I'm okay with that.  In fact, my younger daughter, when she was six, she defiantly yelled to me that she is a lesbian.  I told her that it is fine for her to be a lesbian, but I'm not going to worry about it until she is old enough to start having sex, then we can talk about being safe and responsible about sex.  Until then, she is to enjoy being a kid, whose parents love her just how she is.  She is a very girly girl, loves her dresses and makeup, and isn't interested in boys.  At the age of eight, I'd expect nothing else.  The fact that we haven't made it an issue makes her comfortable being herself, in appropriate stages of herself-ness.

And, my younger son's favourite colour is pink, while my older son is a homophobe (compliments of his father).  I'm okay with the one, not okay with the other.

Also, in Kabukicho I recommend you go to Mon Cheri if you can find it - it's not far from where all the love hotels are, and it's an awesome and cheap shot-bar with an old-school vibe and an owner that makes a great martini.


If you go to a small izakaya that's just frequented by Japanese people, you'll get a lot of interest and probably some free drinks from the owner. Plus, you'll have been brave enough to do something a lot of visitors to Japan unbelievably never do.


Also, go to a tachinomi (stand and drink) - there's some good ones in Hibiya. Gaijin barely ever go there, and you'll have great fun eating yakitori and drinking beer cheek and jowl with salary-men.

In all seriousness, I've not yet decided what I want to do with it once it's completed.

I don't know that I really need any of that, though. The best suggestion, I think, came from someone in this thread: a home office. Right now, I have my computer and such in the master bedroom, which reminds me a little too much of college. It'd be easy to run electricity and maybe ethernet down there. Sure, it's a bit out of the way, but there is something cool about that level of isolation. And I figure it's important to separate the functions of rooms. Right now, when I go into my bedroom, it's a place to sleep and a place to log onto Reddit and Google Reader and such. And there's always temptation to watch something on my computer as I go to sleep, which I suspect isn't good for an efficient sleep.

Yes, the money is a factor -- but honestly 99.9% of the flash games out there are just completely unplayable on a touch-only device, with no keyboard, no input besides clicking, and the meager few that are playable, end up being more like ""whack-a-mole"" than skill based games.

And, if they did allow access to Flash, and the games did improve -- you still have a shitty layer gobbling CPU, delegating NOTHING to the much more efficient GPU, and offering FAR INFERIOR graphics in return.

So, now users have shitty games, with shitty graphics, that inexplicably take 2-3X the processing power and battery. Phones die faster...

Yeah, it's no fucking wonder Apple doesn't want Flash muddying the platform. 

Honestly, Flash is really shitty. I'm glad people are standing up against it. Adobe hasn't made a good product in a long time, and as someone who is forced to use their software daily, it's frustrating that people think they shit rainbows and puppydogs.

Photoshop is shit, Acrobat and Reader are shit, Flash is shit, Dreamweaver (sadly) has become a giant pile of shit, ColdFusion was always shit (no surprise there)... 

Adobe needs to get their act together and stop making bloated, rehashed versions of older software with shinier UI's attached. They need to fix the fundamental and core issues with ALL of their technologies, including Flash, before I ever want to see their products released to a mobile platform.

Android people -- enjoy having Flash as a battery-destroying gimmick... because that's all Flash on a mobile platform will ever be. ","1272674018"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I'm kind of the same socially, although a bit less severe than your situation seems to be. Here are my thoughts:

If your old friends won't talk to you, try sending a mature email. Say you miss their friendship, and that you do not know why they want to end it. Ask them if they will at least do you the courtesy of an explanation. Do not passive-aggressively apologize without knowing what the problem is. And if it is a petty reason, cut your losses because they aren't worth it. You might also want to ask any mutual friends what the deal is, and ask them to be honest.

As for parties... play the games. Whether it's cards, pong, what have you, try to get involved, because the games often facilitate conversation and give participants an unawkward focal point. As you get used to these types of things, try to speak up a bit more, learn people's names, create a dialogue between specific individuals. Running dialogue and inside jokes over the course of the night are a good way to be remembered.

Lastly, if you smoke, find the stoners. I've found that when you're at a party where you don't know many people, the stoners are often the least judgmental and most friendly. There's something about sharing a bowl that knocks down some of the outermost barriers, I guess.

Assholes aren't worth the effort. If someone's a douche, just avoid them and be cool about it, starting drama is a good way to kill the buzz.

And, most importantly, although you are trying to step outside your comfort zone, STILL BE YOURSELF. Do not fake a personality to try to fit in. For one, you won't really be happy with those people. Second, they can usually tell. It might seem like trying to speak up more and being yourself are at odds with each other, but as you get more comfortable around others, you'll find that this is not really the case.","1272674044"

If you leave out of Galveston then you can typically stay at a local hotel (i.e. Galveston Hilton) and park your car in their lot and take their shuttle to the ship all for the same price as it would have been to park at the pier.  When my wife and I took cruises out of Galveston we would drive down the night before and do this.

Most of the mainstream cruises IMO use lower fares and then try to nickel + dime the revenue out of their customers.  If you are frugal then book your cruise, but don't spend as much on the ship.

For example, most of the ports you would visit will be Mexico or Carribean.  You don't need to take any of the ships tours which are 200% the normal cost for these ports.  Just get off the ship and there will be local tour guides there that you can work a deal with.  Otherwise check out cruisecritic.com forums and you can pre-book some stuff for less.

If you don't want to pay $6-7 per drink on the boat you can put some booze in your luggage.  Use plastic bottles and if you are really paranoid put it in a mouthwash bottle or something.  All of the rules say you can't do this, but I've done it around 10x with no problem.

The cruise staff typically works on tips which are paid the last night of the cruise, so don't skip out on them because I think this is the only money they get.  Expect about $10/day per person total for tips.

Even if you aren't a cruise type then it is worth doing once.  Try to get something that is in ports more than half of the days because the days at sea can get boring unless you like sitting out by the pool.  Also take a look at the port times as some cruises will do stupid stuff like give you 4 hours in a port where you can't really do anything.","1272674063"

 the printing press was great because it promoted widespread literacy for even the most numerous and lowest class, which fundamentally altered their intelligence and vulnerability to manipulation. very similar to the internet, but were are talking about people that are alive, and affect the world today. 

the way the internet differs from the radio, telephone, television, and printing press is that anyone can broadcast audio, video, and text and an incredibly low cost to an incredibly large audience. to get exposure to everyone via books it takes a publisher and lots of money. to get exposure via tv it takes a ridiculous amount of money, and you are highly subject to censorship. to get a message to a large audience via phone is just outright inefficient and ultimately expensive.

it's also not just about being able to send/receive information on a wider scale, but a breaking down of cultural barriers and a blending of culture not subject to physical limitations. the internet is changing the world much like the printing press, telephone, radio, and tv, but to an exponential degree. it is affecting everyone despite their demographics, but it affects our generation more because we haven't know a world without it, and are practically raised by the internet, exposing us at an impressionable and young age to so many more cultures, ideas, and influences than any other generation alive.","1272674107"

If you want a GREAT beer selection (One of the best in the city) Try Jerry's in WP/BTown or West loop They have an insanely large menu that is very veggie friendly

"politics","t5_2cneq","It says ""Lawful Contact"" and ""reasonable suspicion"". That applies to more than just pulling someone over for a traffic stop. If the police see you on the street and go to talk to you, that's lawful contact. They just wouldn't be able to bust down the door to your home and ask to verify your citizenship. They can, however, stop you on the street. And, to quote Saturday Night Live, is there anything more Nazi than ""Can I see your papers?""

Section 4 E means they can pull people over driving in their cars just on ""reasonable suspicion"" of them transporting illegal immigrants. So if they see a bunch of Hispanics driving in a car, they can pull them over because it's ""suspicious"". 
Combine that with section 1 E:

&gt; A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER, WITHOUT A WARRANT, MAY ARREST A PERSON IF THE OFFICER HAS PROBABLE CAUSE TO BELIEVE THAT THE PERSON HAS COMMITTED ANY PUBLIC OFFENSE THAT MAKES THE PERSON REMOVABLE FROM THE UNITED STATES.

So now we're arresting people without warrants because we think they may be illegal. So much for innocent until proven guilty. 

Basically, the biggest problem with this law is that it circumvents the court system- Police officers can stop people on a whim. And even though they still technically need probably cause to arrest someone, they get to bypass the court system which enforces that.","1272674218"

While I was working at a Uni in Yokohama, a colleague disappeared for around a week. We finally found out he'd had a few too many drinks and for some reason had tried to walk out of a bar without paying. He got a bit physical and got taken down and lugged off to prison. If he'd paid and - most importantly - APOLOGISED - he would never have gone to jail.

"Ubuntu","t5_2qh62","Yes, if you have CompizConfig Settings Manager installed, you can do this using the Grid plugin. You can find CCSM in the software center - so install that.

Then, after launching CCSM, marvel a bit at all of your options. Yay.

The Grid plugin is in the last section, ""Window Management"" at the bottom of the right window. You can get there quickly by selecting the ""Window Management"" category on the left. See Grid? Activate it by clicking the checkbox next to the name.

If you click on ""Grid"" you'll see its key bindings. You can set these to whatever you prefer, but I like the defaults.

If you have a window selected, hit ctrl-alt numpad-6. This will put your window on the right half of the screen. If you hit ctrl-alt numpad-9, it will be in the upper right quarter, just like the 9 is on your numpad. 8 is top half, 2 is bottom half, and 5 in the middle will either maximize, or have the window take the middle third of the screen if it's already maximized.

Anyway, so that's Grid, and I use it all the time.","1272674356"

I'm not a confident player (yet) so I don't early rush.  I'm play more turtle style until I feel comfortable to put my units out there.  I noticed that my opponent was going Muta so I went mass sentry.  He never attacked with his muta and I had a good unit combination in front of my base plus a bunch of extra sentries hanging out in mineral line.

The Zerg player was trying to punish me for turtling by taking several expansions at once so I pushed out with a good timing attack and knocked out two expansions quickly.  As I marched towards his main, the mutas flew into my base.  Since I had those sentries there, I turned on the guardian sheild, wiped out his (rather large) muta force and won the game.  

Before I learned that sentries countered mutas, I had a hard time.  One guy just sent wave after wave of mutas and made it impossible for me to get a force together to attack.  I wasted so much money on cannons which  he would eventually take out quickly.  I eventually gg'ed that game.

Go research agriculture economics. It's very difficult for _any farmer_ to raise prices, because there are _so many sources_ in the market, that such a collusion is near impossible to arrange. (This trait is unique to small farming, where the number of suppliers is astronomic. This doesn't apply to giant factory farming corporations who have enormous sway in the price of food).  

Even if they did, (and prices would inevitably go up some), the increase would be dwarfed by the increase in cost of importing and shipping goods cost country -- and that's the point.

Yes, more profit in local farming is a **good thing**, as that spurs more people to get into it, more businesses to invest, and more innovation to occur. Most farming innovation happens in factory farms, not on a small farmer level. I still fail to see how it's a bad thing. ","1272674481"

I bought over $300 worth of songs from iTunes, then that whole collection got de-authorized by Apple.  I did nothing wrong.  I contacted Apple and was pretty much told to go to hell.  So I have no moral problem downloading music.  I don't upload music to anybody, nor do I make discs for people.  If you figure 550 CDs times $12.50, (some CDs cost upwards of $18) that's about $6700.  Add in the $300 that Apple screwed me out of, $7000.

Perhaps you are overly concerned with making all people the same. Cultural diversity isn't always a bad thing, it can enrich your country. Why turn everyone into the same mold?

Integration issues are often caused by the host society feeling superior. These brown people are treated as social inferiors, their kids get taunted in school, there is subtle discrimination in housing, employment, etc. Then they turn to themselves and walls are created. Then you blame them for not integrating.

Canada is a great example of how these things ought to be done. They have an egalitarian culture, much milder issues of racism than most Europeans countries, and yet they have vibrant and thriving foreign cultures well established in their country. I think Europe still has a long way to go.","1272674634"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","&gt;Imagine if you're home was bulldozed. All the possessions that you couldn't get out in time are destroyed with it and you have no where to go.

Again, bulldozing is itself neutral. Was my home bulldozed because it was destroyed in a flood? Because it was taken by eminent domain? What? The ""bulldozed"" has nice emotional appeal, but only that.

&gt;but when it is intended to convince the Palestinian Authority to accept a deal, then it fits perfectly into that definition.

Nope. Actions by one government to another are not terrorism. Terrorism is violence directed against civilians.

&gt;And there are laws in this conflict as well. The UN Charter, to which Israel is a signatory. The acquisition of territory through war is illegal. And it's reiterated very clearly in resolution 242, referring specifically to the occupied territories.

242 is deliberately vague. And what is Israel supposed to do with property taken in a war when the country they got it from does not want it and the people who do won't agree to a peace treaty? 

&gt;Many cultures have been resisting foreign occupation since WWII and they usually involve a combination of violent (never to be condoned) and nonviolent approaches. Algeria, South Africa, India &amp; Pakistan, Iraq. 

Iraq? Do you mean the Kurds? And, yes, the India and Pakistan case in an important one. Somehow that never gets mentioned here even though it would seem to have all of the same qualities as Israel/Palestine. Why do you think so many people here condemn Israel and are ignorant about Kashmir?

&gt;Maybe you have something in mind that works as a closer analogy here where people willingly gave up their land or rights. 

I was thinking that the people moved in the India/Pakistan separation built lives on something other than continuing the fight. The millions of refugees in Europe settled down and built lives, not bombs. But Jordan and Lebanon and Syria kept people in refugee camps and only supported violent efforts. The Palestinians are refugees in camps because of political decisions made by various Arab leaders, not because Israel is evil.

&gt;If the UN decided that the Romani people should have their own state and that 50% of the Israel would be given to them, I doubt that many Israelis would be happy about having to give up their homes. 

Are there 2,500 year old Romani communities in Israel? Have the Romani been trying to return to Israel for 2,000 years? Did they move in legally by buying land and building communities? 

&gt;This is basically the attitude of the Palestinians today and sadly, it is not easy to repair that damage.

The Palestinians today feel that way for many reasons, only some of which you can put on Israel's doorstep. The Arabs objected that the Ottomans got rid of the dhimmi laws, they objected that Jews were buying land, they objected to legal immigration and to Jews escaping the Holocaust by legally moving to the Mandate. All of that predates any violent actions by the Jews.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I understand that, but the point remains:

(link)[http://www.slate.com/id/2219162]

There is a section indicating that cooking the food breaks down certain fibers and generally makes the food easier to digest, which ""helped liberate extra calories from the food"" which (in addition to other factors, of course) was a huge boon back then but, as I said above, the same amount of food now, if cooked -- especially in certain ways -- will liberate those calories in an undesirable way (unless you need those extra calories).  I'm not saying cooking is bad and we ought to go raw, but the caloric difference is noticable enough to be mentioned.

In the same vein, I had seen or heard of a study (can't seem to find it) that involved mice eating the same caloric amount of food, but one form was solid and the other was pulverized or presented some other way (I know that ""processed"" has two meanings here so I'm trying to avoid that term).  The mice gained much more weight in the ""processed"" case.  The conclusion was to link obesity to ""processed"" foods because food companies make food such that 1) food is constituted to be easily digested (fibers removed, tough bits broken down a bit more) or 2) add substitutes that are pretty much just pure shots of what they are replacing (e.g. rather than using natural sweeteners, they may use HFCS which, though it may have the same ""calories"" is digested much differently).

Again, I'm not saying that we should go raw, but cooking food is, in some effect, doing certain things along the lines of what food corps do, and the results aren't different in nature (though they differ in scale).  Cooked food gives you more calories than the non-cooked equivalent.","1272674725"

Frankly, I'm certain she experienced some race-based prejudice, but I'm also certain she benefited from race-based preferences too. Your point about label based on the color of their skin... in America, we call a group of people 'black'. You called this lady 'white'.

I'm fortunate enough to not have any loans or debt, but I still can't just up and leave my life behind (however tempting). I'm in a 6 year relationship with someone and we live together, I want to stay out of debt so not working isn't an option.

I'm underpaid relative to other people who hold a senior accountant job title by over 20% ( I also pay for my own health insurance) along with a shitty commute, and I work a second job as a contractor.

I think a lot of people my age are in very unstable and unpredictable situations right now.

Water and other volatile compounds (like things you can taste) will move around, and temperature variations and inadequate protection from air will make it worse. Modern freezers also have an auto-defrost cycle to prevent ice build up on the freezer but this makes the problem slightly worse.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","See, here's the problem for me on this one.

I support animal testing for medical purposes. Of course I'd prefer it if all testing could be done via simulation or other means, but sadly, that's not always the case that it's feasible or even possible to extract meaningful data without experimentation. Plenty of scientific advances can be attributed to animal experiments, and as a headline example, I think most diabetics are grateful for the availability of insulin which wouldn't have been possible if not for the original work with cows.

So yes, I support medical animal research. Cosmetic etc is another matter, of course, but there you go.

However, I'm also a sympathetic human being - and a chinchilla owner, no less. And it's impossible not to have an emotional ""those poor floofy animals :'("" reaction to a story like this. [They're floofy!](http://www2.apebox.org/wordpress/wp-content/gallery/00-single/IMG_0891.JPG)

And, on top of that, I'm a little annoyed by the ""why not use rats or mice instead?"" comments - if you're saying that chinchillas are above ""the line"" for whether an animal is acceptable for use in animal medical research, what's wrong with rats? Rats are smarter, more affectionate animals than chinchillas, why throw them under the proverbial bus? If you want to say that ALL animal research is unacceptable, then fine, take that position. But it's disingenuous to say that some animals are more worthy than others of your concern. Would you spare some love for a [blobfish](http://www.ucalgary.ca/news/files/news/images/blobfish.jpg)?

Don't hate on medical research just because chinchillas are floofy. Hate on it because we haven't obsoleted it entirely yet.

Consciousness is not a thoroughly agreed upon matter. No measures exist, most likely because of the nature of the problem.

However tests like the mirror test (can a creature recognise itself in a mirror) are purported to give insight into the depth of a creature's mind. If sentience and consciousness are discussed together, I certainly think that we are implying a level of intelligence that can self-recognise, and therefore undoubtedly *think*, rather than just 'sense' and 'react' like the chinchilla does.

I think it would be wrong to tie consciousness strictly into 'higher reasoning' (considering there IS no strict definition of consciousness and what it definitively entails)... however if you are discussing the philosophy of mind then that is certainly the direction a lot of interest and experimentation goes.","1272674918"

Dogs (Waters, Gilmour) 

You gotta be crazy, you gotta have a real need.
You gotta sleep on your toes, and when you're on the street,
You gotta be able to pick out the easy meat with your eyes closed.
And then moving in silently, down wind and out of sight,
You gotta strike when the moment is right without thinking.

And after a while, you can work on points for style.
Like the club tie, and the firm handshake,
A certain look in the eye and an easy smile.
You have to be trusted by the people that you lie to,
So that when they turn their backs on you,
You'll get the chance to put the knife in.

You gotta keep one eye looking over your shoulder.
You know it's going to get harder, and harder, and harder as you
get older.
And in the end you'll pack up and fly down south,
Hide your head in the sand,
Just another sad old man,
All alone and dying of cancer.

And when you loose control, you'll reap the harvest you have sown.
And as the fear grows, the bad blood slows and turns to stone.
And it's too late to lose the weight you used to need to throw
around.
So have a good drown, as you go down, all alone,
Dragged down by the stone.

I gotta admit that I'm a little bit confused.
Sometimes it seems to me as if I'm just being used.
Gotta stay awake, gotta try and shake off this creeping malaise.
If I don't stand my own ground, how can I find my way out of this
maze?

Deaf, dumb, and blind, you just keep on pretending
That everyone's expendable and no-one has a real friend.
And it seems to you the thing to do would be to isolate the winner
And everything's done under the sun,
And you believe at heart, everyone's a killer.

Soul Wound:
The Legacy of Native American Schools

U.S. and Canadian authorities took Native children from their homes and tried to school, and sometimes beat, the Indian out them. Now Native Americans are fighting the theft of language, of culture, and of childhood itself.
http://www.amnestyusa.org/amnestynow/soulwound.html

Dolphus is one of more than 100,000 Native Americans forced by the U.S. government to attend Christian schools. The system, which began with President Ulysses Grant's 1869 “Peace Policy,” continued well into the 20th century. Church officials, missionaries, and local authorities took children as young as five from their parents and shipped them off to Christian boarding schools; they forced others to enroll in Christian day schools on reservations. Those sent to boarding school were separated from their families for most of the year, sometimes without a single family visit. Parents caught trying to hide their children lost food rations.

Virtually imprisoned in the schools, children experienced a devastating litany of abuses, from forced assimilation and grueling labor to widespread sexual and physical abuse. Scholars and activists have only begun to analyze what Joseph Gone (Gros Ventre), a psychology professor at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, calls “the cumulative effects of these historical experiences across gender and generation upon tribal communities today.”

“Native America knows all too well the reality of the boarding schools,” writes Native American Bar Association President Richard Monette, who attended a North Dakota boarding school, “where recent generations learned the fine art of standing in line single-file for hours without moving a hair, as a lesson in discipline; where our best and brightest earned graduation certificates for homemaking and masonry; where the sharp rules of immaculate living were instilled through blistered hands and knees on the floor with scouring toothbrushes; where mouths were scrubbed with lye and chlorine solutions for uttering Native words.” ","1272675000"

You don't need to use EVERY single project you do and post it on your portfolio page, I know this is what most designers are thinking when they make things ""oh shit I don't want to put this on my portfolio"", but the simple solution is to just not put it on your portfolio.","1272675067"

Maybe they should look at what European countries pay and decide that a 1+$ tax per gallon to invest in crumbling infrastructure and new energy science and innovation would help them in the long run. They would use less oil, lessen the need to poison oceans like this and maybe with that kick start they wouldn’t be so far behind in energy. I’m so sick of Americans justifying drilling by saying “What else are we going to do?”

No nuke plants built for 35-40yrs, freeway system 50-60yrs old, still living off black gold like 100yrs ago and finally just now giving permits for the first offshore wind farm. What was the reason behind that again? I don’t want to ruin my view of my magnificent polluted oceans!

Lie to your parents, take a few ""conversion"" classes, and get the hell out of their home and into college with them paying for it. you dont need 4 years of tuition loans hanging over your head, especially due to some parental closed-mindedness.  After a few weeks tell them you're ""cured"" and it was all just a freak sickness. Keep them happy as long as it takes to get your degree. During summers when there are no classes, live somewhere other than home so you dont cramp your lifestyle too much.  You can 'come out' to them again later, but for gods sake get that tuition money.

I have sat on both...The chairs are elevated, and to sit properly on a yoga ball, your legs (Thighs) should be parallel to the ground when your feet are flat on the floor...the chairs ruin this.  Also, the chair holds the ball stationary.  When you sit on the ball alone, you use your legs and your back and ab muscles to hold your posture.  You need to re-adjust  every so often.  You don't need to do this with the chair because it's stable.  It's just a really weird chair.

Also, the yoga balls are cheap (Mine was a little over $10) the chairs can be over $200.  I think they are an excuse to get you to spend more money so you have a ""real"" chair.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Well, there's about 40% of Americans that participate in the cot-caught merger, if I remember correctly (merging to something like the 'a' in ""father""). It varies by region, but even within regions where the merger is occurring, there are pockets where it hasn't. My dialect in general has the merger, but speakers from my subregion don't have it (I'm from Northern Michigan, kinda close to where your pinky meets your palm). It's not a matter of it being incorrect or correct --- some speakers have this change and some don't.

But anyways, in regards to the original question, ""vace"" rhymes with ""face"" for me. Using the low back vowel sounds stuffy and British. Relatedly, ""paws"" and ""pause"" are homophonic for me, and ""cot"" and ""caught"" are different.","1272675248"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","My gym teacher in high school was an extremely butch woman who prided herself on her wrestling skills, and was known to spontaneously wrestle some of the boys to the ground when they were around (we had segregated gym class). 

We hated each other from the first day of the first class I had with her, two years before this. She threw my Pearl Jam shirt onto the gym floor for 'not putting it away': from then on we never got along at all.

One day in high school, this woman pulled me into her office and told me in a hilariously aggressive way that I needed to find Jesus. I stopped her, told her I had to go and walked out. Only time I ever walked out on a teacher; I thought about going to the principal and pulling an offended act, but I didn't really give a shit, so I just went to my locker, got my stuff and left. I didn't figure she'd turn me in, because she'd have to explain why I left, and she didn't. I went home and found Kurt Loder instead.

I also had a 'history' teacher who would allow me to spend entire class periods drawing obscene theme parks on the blackboard while explaining each ride to the class. The 'Billy Beamer Santa Bastard Saucer Sled Ride' was a favorite, although come August none of us were very informed about history.

I also had a science teacher who wore earmuffs indoors in summer, a French teacher who was known to jump up on the desks and throw chalk when angry, and an English teacher who hated his subject and once told the class poetry was dead. There's something in the water here, I think.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","As I understand the law, police can only ask for citizenship or immigration status if they have a ""reasonable doubt"" that a person may be an illegal immigrant.  This is the same standard that is used to pull you over for any crime and the same standard that is used to get a warrant to investigate any crime in the United States.

All the racial profiling rhetoric, police state talk, and pulling over anyone to ""ask for their papers"" is how the political debate is being spun today.

It is the same as the Republicans telling the people that the Health Care Bill would permit ""Death Panels"" to decide if your Grandparents were going to be put to death or not.

If the police will pull over ""brown"" people to ""ask for their papers"" without probable cause, then this will be like being pulled over and hassled for ""driving while black"".  It is reprehensible, immoral, and against the Constitution of the United States of America.

That's not to say that this may happen but, as I understand it, the new AZ immigration law expressly prohibits this and the governor of AZ added a more detailed ""executive order"" to make it clear that such behavior by police in AZ will not be tolerated.

I would hope to hear a more reasoned explanation about the new law, as well, but the partisan ""outrage"" is clouding the truth.

If someone has a non-partisan, unbiased link to the truth, I would appreciate the information.

"gadgets","t5_2qgzt","Regardless, Jobs did approach Wozniak with the job and two of his own requirements which are now legendary. Woz would get half of the fee which was claimed at $700 and no mention of a bonus. In fact, the way Jobs described it, if they could design it in under 50 chips, they'd get 700 bucks; and if it was under 40 chips, they'd get $1000. Likewise the second catch - it had to be done in four days. As Wozniak later found out, ""Atari didn't put us on a time schedule; Steve did. I had to do it in four days because Steve had to catch an airplane to Oregon. I was the designer-the engineer-and Steve was a breadboarder and test technician.""2

Wozniak had designed it by hand, under the continuing pressure of Jobs to get it done quick (though he wouldn't say why). Doing the designs during the day while at HP, at night Jobs would wirewrap the design under his guidance. Wozniak also spent much of his time those four nights playing Gran Trak 10, the game monopolizing most of the manufacturing assembly line at the time. Towards the end of the 4 day non-stop marathon, Woz's Breakout prototype was almost finished. Wozniak was able to get the number of TTL's down to a startling 42 chips, but still had a few problems he wasn't happy with. When all was said in done, the Breakout prototype that was submitted by Jobs to Allan and Nolan had 46 chips and left everyone very impressed. They paid Jobs in cash, the $700 plus the bonus - which turned out to be a total of $5,000! Jobs turned around and paid an unknowing Wozniak the original $350 they had agreed upon.","1272675369"

His performance and reputation are affected if this strategy is employed. Assuming his pay is measured by performance, his pay will be affected as well. As you appear to have experience with this issue, can you think of another, more desirable, solution?

All of us have to face a choice at some point: do what's best for me right now, at the cost of long term happiness.  Or do what's best for me long term, at the cost of my own short term happiness.

Every human being is a teacher.  We don't understand this, but it's true.  The way we act and react to circumstances helps to condition other human beings.  When you reward dumb executive decisions with success by disobeying those decisions behind managers' backs, what are you teaching management?  What is management learning?

Is there a way where you can have your cake and eat it too?  Not to my knowledge.  Sacrifice is often necessary.  Of course people don't want to sacrifice anything, but that's also why people find themselves in terrible, oppressive and closed-minded cultures.  Nobody wants to take one on the chin.  The result: idiot executives who run companies into the ground, while everyone around them is struggling.  It doesn't have to be like that.

There are other ways to change our broken executive culture, but they are all slower, and not necessarily less risky.  Or they are faster but more risky.  They either involve more coercion or more time or both.

One way to fight bad executive culture is by speaking up against it, anonymously, on the internet.  If you work at a newspaper, you can try to publish an article about the broken executive culture (this of course will cause the newspaper executives to get itchy).  If you work at a TV station, you can try to run a segment on the broken executive culture, and this of course will likely cause TV executives to get itchy, because they will recognize themselves in the criticism.  They'll think ""Yes, I am that bastard.  I am either evil or incompetent or both.  And I don't want to change.  I can't admit to my flaws... maybe I should do something to cancel this segment.""  Nonetheless, we must do everything we can to communicate upward, even at the cost of our lives when necessary.  If we don't, we'll be working toward a more and more despotic culture.  We are all teachers.  Are we teaching people how to be despots?  Are we teaching people that if they act despotically, we are OK with it?

Suppose there was no internet.  Could you still communicate upward?  Sure you could.  You could send out a newsletter to people who are on the same wavelength as you.  You could then print leaflets and sprinkle them around your work place.  You can pin papers with poignant questions on the cork-board in the water cooler room.  No one is going to know who put that paper there unless there is a camera in the fucking water cooler room, and I don't know any company that's that evil.  So there are ways to communicate upward that have minimal risk to your career.  All these methods are extremely slow though.

After you communicate something a million times, consistently, the executive culture will begin to change.  This takes a lot of patience and discipline on the part of the communicator.  You have to teach other people to do what you are doing, so that you're not the only one who is trying to send a message to executives that they don't really want to hear.

With the internet, things are easier.  Your speaking ability is amplified.

Another, very effective way, is to start your own company and make sure its executive culture is not fucked up.  For some ideas of what kind of culture is not fucked up, I suggest you watch this video http://mitworld.mit.edu/video/308, and then when you're done, research Ricardo Semler and Semco for some ideas and insight.  So, if you can create or take over another company and institute a progressive culture in it, and then beat the companies with broken cultures, you can put them out of business.  Other entrepreneurs will pick up on your success and do the same thing.  Eventually all companies with bad cultures will be put out of business.  Obviously doing this is by no means easy, fast, cheap, and risk free!!  This method, if you have the money and balls for it, is much more effective than malicious compliance from within.

Or you can go the old fashioned way, and organize a strike.  Organizing strikes is not easy in an industry where people are well paid.  Most people seem to prefer their own short term interests to what's good for themselves in the long run.

Who will benefit from a better culture?  We all will, including you.  So if you contribute something toward creating a better culture, even if you take one on the chin today, maybe your son or daughter will have a better world to live in than you.  If we just look at our near term happiness, we are slowly but surely all going to hell, together, by creating a culture of hell.

- Subvert from within (this is a sneaky method; malicious compliance is one such method).
- Communicate (safe but slow).
- Compete from without (effective and fast, but expensive and risky).
- Organized coercion (that's what Union movements do).

If your company has a policy to promote from within (and many companies have abandoned such policy), then you can attempt to rise up the ranks, and then when you have gained a sufficient rank, try to change the culture then.  Needless to say this method is super-slow and the results are very uncertain.  It's possible that by the time you rise up the ranks the company may go out of business, or you might develop cancer and die.  There is no guarantee you can see this through.  But if you have life-long dedication, discipline, and good health(!), you can try to rise up the ranks and affect change that way.

That's all I can think of at the moment.  I am sure if you put your mind to it, you can think of other ways, if not now, then eventually.","1272675374"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","My good friend and I were living with one other close friend, who, after a year, decided to move back home to save money. We both realized that although it'd cost a bit more, we could certainly afford to take the hit and keep our 3 bedroom place and not have another roommate. After a few months, an old friend came back in to our lives... 

This guy, we'll call him James, has always been a good friend of ours. I have no doubt that, even to this day, James would take a bullet for either one of us. We grew up together, got in trouble together, made mistakes together, and had fun together. We had been damn near inseparable while growing up. Long story short, we both got in to drugs together, but he never got out of them. 

James called me up out of the blue, after not speaking to him for a couple of years, telling me he'd found a job near where I was living, and just needed a new place to live. He'd been at a sober living house for a year or so, and claimed to be clean now. I was really proud of him, and being such close friends with us, the roomie and I didn't hesitate to welcome him in. We didn't ask for a deposit (didn't really need it for various reasons), or last month's rent, just the first, obviously. And we made it reasonably cheap for him so he could get back on his feet. 

So James moves in, hands us the cash with a big smile on his face, looking like he had most of his shit together, and we were excited to have an old friend back in our lives. Fast forward a month. James had bought a car off of the roomie's girlfriend. He gave her half of the cash, and told her he'd get her the rest in a few weeks. He also managed to only give us half the rent for that month, telling us the same thing. From that day out, we stopped seeing so much of him around the house... 

We never got the rest of the rent money for that month, but chalked it up to James just having a tough time getting his act together, so we let it slide. I mean, hey, we were paying for the place without his help before just fine, and he's a good friend, so no worries. The third month comes around, and James is full of excuses. He doesn't have our rent money, he hasn't paid the roomie's girlfriend the remainder of what he owed her, and there was a strange smell emanating from his room. 

(Side note: our house was 3 stories, with two bedrooms and bathrooms plus laundry room on the top floor, entrance and common area on the middle floor, and James' room plus garage on the bottom. Since our garage was mostly storage space for us, we didn't go down there much, as there was no need.)

Things started to get weird. James would get very defensive about the smallest thing. He got in an argument with me because I went to grab food without telling him. He called me an asshole, among other things, because I kept nagging him for the rent money he hadn't paid. He threatened roomie's girlfriend. He would be awake at strange hours watching TV with the volume way up, or blasting music. The roomie and I decided that was it, we couldn't deal with this any more. There were many other things that led up to the decision, but they don't really matter. Long story short, we had a sit down with him, and told him he needed to go. We couldn't live our lives like this. He did nothing to help around the house, didn't pay rent, was unhygienic, and causing drama constantly. 

Surprisingly, he left without much of a fight. He told us he understood, and would be out in two days. We didn't bother to help him, he packed up, and left. 

A day later, the roomie and I went down to his room to survey the damage, if any, and clean up so we could turn it back in to our office/lounge area. When we opened the door, we weren't quite ready for what greeted us. 

He left, well, most of his stuff. A large dresser, his bed, desk, floor lamp, television, etc. The mattress was stained with what looked like blood and fuck knows what else. The floors were covered in various unidentifiable stains as well. The room smelled like 6 day old garbage left in the souther California summer sun. There were at least one hundred various fast food bags scattered about the room, some empty, some not so much. Spiderwebs infested the corners of the ceiling. Dust was everywhere, as not a single cleaning product had touched any surface of this room since he'd moved in. This paragraph doesn't do justice to what we had come upon. 

So we grabbed some rubber gloves, and got to it. It took us 3 days to get the room completely clean, and about another 2 weeks until the smell wasn't really noticeable anymore. 

Beyond that, he never totally paid for the car he bought, so the roomie had to track him down and tell him that if he didn't come by in the next week with payment for the car, he was going to report it stolen, and we were going to donate or sell everything he left there. He came back a week later with a strange girl in a truck behind him. He gave back the car, and demanded the money he had paid. Roomie told him to fuck off. He grabbed his shit and left, and that was the last time I saw him. 

As a bit of an epilogue, he emailed me a few months later saying that he had been back on meth (shocker, right?), and totally understood why we kicked him out. That he had no hard feelings, and he apologized for everything he had done. He was trying to get his life cleaned up again. 

Last I heard, James was still on meth and now heroin, and not doing so well. And by not so well I mean really, really bad. He was one of my best friends, someone I thought would be around until the day I died as a friend, and when I heard the extent of the damage he had done to himself lately, I felt nauseous. I still wish I could do something for him, but you can't help someone that doesn't really want to help themselves. 

**tl;dr:** Long time friend moves in, goes back to meth, steals, threatens, fights, and leaves our place a disgusting wreck. He's still on drugs and I am sad. ","1272675390"

He decided that since I was on painkillers that I posed a threat too general population, due to my altered state of mind.

Add that too the fact that I needed to keep my hand for the most part sterile, he found it justifiable that I be placed in what was called ""Medical isolation"" which is really a code-word for isolation, with whatever extra restrictions they feel like adding. That is until a physician (not a nurse) deemed me fit to enter main population.

To further the breast analogy, I personally could care less if women feel like running around scantily clad on beaches, on tv, in broad daylight even, I do not care. Breasts are at least as beautiful as faces to me. However, I generally choose to cover my breasts when I am not in the privacy of my own home. I imagine you and/or the women in your life do as well. Indeed we would all be outraged were legislation passed banning chest coverings: all breasts must be bare! Can you imagine the indignity?

As sandor pointed out that you are actually lucky right now because you haven't put your life into this relationship. Yes, it's going to really hurt for awhile, but it will get better with time. I've been there, and got the t-shirt to prove it!;-)

Time is going to be your friend right now, and you're going to go through quite a lot emotionally, but eventually you'll come out for the better with a greater understanding about relationships, and people in general. I'm not going to sugar coat it and tell you that you're going to immediately start to feel better because it hurts when you lose a friend and even worse if it's a lover. You will get over it, but it's just a matter of time.

The great thing about you posting is that you have the benefit of all of our experience, and I wish I had something like this when my ex and I split.

"Ubuntu","t5_2qh62","(I use EXT3 so that is what I know)

The filesystem can only hold certain kinds of metadata, like date or owner. So, you have put the metadata in the file (JPEG, MP3) or in a separate database (metadata database).

I've personally thought about putting metadata in files and writing a wrapper function for read and write, but it would be a pain in the neck. If a wrapper function was used, all programs that needed to read the file would need to use it. This new metadata-added file would become a format of its own.

Second problem with in-file metadata involves appending and truncating. If the tags are at the front (which would make tag functions faster), adding or deleting tags requires the payload data to be shifted. If the tags are at the back (like MP3), append or truncating would require the tags to be shifted.

You could tar the data file and metadata file together. Then, when you want to open or change anything, untar them and change what you want. This is similar to how OpenOffice did it.

Bitpedia is a great example of home metadata could be used directly in a filesystem. The filesystem determines tags by searching the web database using a key. The database is always having new data added and the data will be the same across different systems.

To osaka, for example, is only about 3 hours and it's a pleasant trip.

You're too early to climb fuji, unfortunately.  There are lots of places you can hire bikes.  In most of the cities i visited we hired bikes and rode outside of town to see a bit of the country side.

Heh, that's not *exactly* what I was going for - my thinking was more that you might end up starving by passing up the sandwich in hope for the steak. Now that I think about it though, we're not going to collapse if we don't drill our oil, it'll just be a little more expensive. Our analogies both kind of sucked. Still though, why pay more for oil when there's oil right under us?

&gt;majority of the value from opening it up will be captured by the extractive industry rather than to the taxpayer or to oil-consumers.

What's good for the goose is good for the gander. When oil reserves are expanded that means a wider supply base for us, the consumer, to purchase from. 

&gt;So taking 75 cents off of that is a miniscule price difference for consumers by the time production finally ramps up.

Oh, I've dropped 75 cents into the couch...a buck in the car, 5 bucks on the street, 20 flew out of my pocket on a carnival ride....

It all adds up, is what I mean. I think we're *almost* on the same page here, though. What I hear from your side on this issue is ""The price change will be miniscule - it's not going to have a big impact anyway. Why are you making such a huge fucking deal about this?""

What we're saying is basically the same in reverse, ""Sure it'll only impact price a little bit, but why pass up that extra savings? Isn't it reasonable that America should make use of its own resources? Why are you making such a big fucking deal about this?""

I don't recall you making an argument about why drilling in ANWR would be bad, though. I know you said it's not worth our time, but that's for private industry to decide, isn't it? Oil companies earning profits doesn't hurt anyone and benefits the country as a whole - the economy is not a zero sum game. By hurting the oil companies you're not making someone else ""win"" - you're just making everyone lose a little more. There's always room for the pie to grow.

"reddit.com","t5_6","What I find interesting about these kind of articles and the comments posted, is the all or nothing mentality people stand behind when expressing their thoughts about new technologies.

In my opinion, not very many new fundamental and game changing ideas have come about in the last 10 years. Companies are just trying to improve old ideas and spin them so we will spend more money. One age old comparison that comes to mind is the automotive industry. New features yes... but all cars have had a steering wheel for quite a while now. 

As for the PC dying and becoming a commodity. The PC is here to stay... Period! Wasn't that the goal of Jobs and Gates? I have heard it said in a number of interviews that each of them wanted every home/family etc, to own a low cost PC.

Moving on....

iPad = Better Windows XP tablet edition and certainly isn't a new concept. Tablet PC died out because it sucked for inputting data, The iPad won't be much better.

Tablets are ok for consuming information and terrible for creating it. (My Opinion)

Next....

Cloud computing = new age Mainframes.

Cloud computing has many benefits but privacy and remote access issues loom. I do back up some things to google, flikr etc.. But I am not going to put my most private data in the hands of a company unless I absolutely have to.

Next....

Wireless data providers can be reliable and convenient, but will not be faster, more secure or MORE reliable than land lines for a while.

The trick to all of this is a mix of technologies and not convincing yourselves or others that technology is going in any one given direction.

I like to play games on my PC and my PS3. Each serve a similar yet separate purpose, but I certainly don't try to create content, or write code on my PS3 and would have little interest to do so on an iPad (and yes I know you can run Linux on a PS3, blah, blah, blah).

I like to watch movies on my PC and my TV and some times my phone. Why exactly do I need to choose one as my sole source of video. 

I think it makes sense that I would use each of these technologies depending on situation and their is nothing wrong with owning multiple devices for multiple situations and purposes. Example... I have a media center hooked up to my big screen and I still subscribe to cable TV and have a DVR.

Long story short.... I want multiple platforms and devices for separate situations with each of them having some functional overlap and if they can communicate with each other..... even better.

First off, I am training to be a Massage Therapist. So with that in mind take what i say with a grain of salt. And please correct me if I am wrong (with reference). 


Your back will not heal properly if it is not properly treated. Now I don't know how far along your herniation is. There is a possibility that you might be at the point where surgery would be your best choice. But i doubt it. Typically a herniated disk is a protrusion of a degenerated or fragmented intervertebral disk into the intervertebal foramen compressing the never root or into the spinal canal compressing the cauda equina. 
Think of it like a raw egg between two stale cup cakes. When you herniate a disk, you are squeezing those stale cupcakes together forcing out that yellow yoke. that yellow yoke trying to oozing out, is now pressing against the nerves of your spine. 

Until you get it professionally treated there is a very good chance that your back is not going to heal properly. When the pain goes away your back might have healed but it has not healed properly. meaning that it can easily be injured again, and again, and again....
I would recommend that you do some stretching. Through out the day and not just for working out. There are some simple exercises that you can do that does not involve weights. Basically you are going to start from the beginning and SLOWLY work your way back up.  Lost of rest as herniation takes forever to heal. 

Everyone that you have seen about this gave you some sound advice. And they are all correct in telling you what (in their professional opinion) would be the best for you. But I could only guess that you never told them that you needed to be physically active. It's something that you should have told them. At best have them refer you to a ""specialist"" that can help you with healing your back and continue your physically active life style.

*By the way, if i was to treat it, I would send you to a specialist who would re-align your back and separate your vertebra. Allowing the disk to return back into it's spot between the vertebra. Then come back to me so i could remove the incorrect scarring and other crud that had built up over the years and help with proper healing. Though you will never be at 100% .You also won't have the problems that you are having now.


Hope that helps a bit.

"gaming","t5_2qh03","Yeah, I would agree with that. Although personally I prefer to play a wider range of games instead of a single genre over and over again, so I'd still prefer them to actually make different types of games. Ultimately speaking I want to always play games that have a fairly significant ""different"" feel to them. For example, the Quake series and the CoD series are both shooters and share many genre similarities, but are much more different than say two CoD games or two Quake games.

Don't get me wrong; I absolutely *loved* Quake, and I played Quake and its modset religiously for about 4 years straight. However, if they managed to update and refine the game and community perfectly so that I could just play refined versions of all the mods I played over ten years ago I wouldn't play it for nearly as long and I wouldn't get as into it. I Played the game, loved it, sunk more hours than any person should ever sink into any game, but I'd prefer to move on to something new and equally exciting; something that's never been done before.

Basically, I stopped playing those older games for a reason. It wasn't because they were bad or lacking, it was because I was finished with them. Trying to market the same game to me again is never going to be as appealing to me as doing something new and unique.","1272675720"

"lisp","t5_2qh35","Let's look at the EuLisp Wikipedia page:

&gt;Its primary characteristics is that it is a Lisp-1 (no separate function 
&gt;and variable namespaces), has a CLOS-style (Common Lisp Object 
&gt;System) generic-function type object-oriented system named TELOS 
&gt;(The EuLisp Object System) integrated from the ground up, has a 
&gt;built-in module system, and is defined in layers to promote the use of 
&gt;the Lisp on small, embedded hardware and educational  machines. It 
&gt;supports continuations, though not as powerfully as Scheme. It has a 
&gt;simple light-weight process mechanism (threads). A frequently 
&gt;mentioned feature of EuLisp was that it allowed programmers to 
&gt;define their own error handlers.

I don't know what your preferred lisp is, but these are pretty interesting from a Scheme perspective. Besides a ""turtles all the way down"" approach (i.e. ""defined in layers to promote the use of Lisp on small, embedded machines and educational machines""). It has a decent amount of Scheme &amp; CL, enough so that it could have been a happy middle-ground, methinks, especially since it was meant to be minimal, but not as much so as the Scheme spec is. 

ISLISP is quite similar: it takes ideas from LeLisp, CL, Scheme &amp; EuLisp, and attempts to make a nice-fitting package (the spec is roughly 1/10 the size of the CL spec) that could be used in an industrial environment (which was part of the original purpose of ISLISP). 

They *both* feel like CL inspired languages, but are much simpler. I think they had interesting ideas (as did Dylan &amp; T), but were rarely used. EuLisp, for instance, Languished from ~1993 until this year. 

I'm pretty interested in ISLISP, as well as Scheme. 

So, **tl;dr**: they were both attempts *rectifying* the two major dialects of Lisp, with an industrial focus (ala CL) and without bloat/baggage (ala Scheme).

Using your logic the human race should raise hoards and hoards of people. So many that the planet almost reaches it carrying capacity. Then we should perform various painful experiments on them. After this we should kill them all off so we would not starve to death. Imagine all of the medical advances that would be made. How our standard of life would improve after they were gone. If we did this than many more people could have a ""turn at life"" right?  We did not kidnap these people. They would not have had a better life if it was not for our medical testing - they would not have had any life. I am only applying your logic. Is this what you want? do you think it would be moral for us to do this?

I am not equating homosexuality to incest, nor ideally were I to do so, should that be a big deal. I assume you're not gay, but notice how I don't presume to think homosexuals would not appreciate you speaking on their behalf. I am equating your _judgement_ of incest, to past judgement of homosexuality, which was oft considered an illness and vilified. So while you think that there exists absolute right and absolute wrong, that has very little bearing on whether or not it is right or wrong for these two people, just as my opinions on homosexuality _should not_ have any bearing on whether gay marriage is right or wrong. I believe you're drawing an arbitrary line in the sand and in an ideal world, should feel just as wrong had you made the same proclamation against an interracial couple. 

And as far as taking advantage goes, the man was 18. I think at some point, you have to make some concessions to personal responsibility and privacy. It's not as if emotional manipulation doesn't happen in every facet of our society, from every type of relationship, why single this one out? Are you saying it's impossible for any relationship of disparate age to work, and therefore insane? Is it the combination of emotional attachment (of which there could have been none as they had never met before) _and_ age? I mean what if this type of relationship is the only thing that works for this man. Thus traumatized by his mother's death, he is unable to relate meaningfully to ""more appropriate"" women? Would you deny him this small happiness?

So really, without simplifying the entire civil rights experiences and issues of blacks, gays, klingons, as interchangeable, why would you give one and deny the other? This is not to disparage the gay rights movement as some sort of slippery slope argument, I'm simply asking, why not?","1272675813"

Well, and the other systems.  But essentially, yes.

On the other hand, the ""person"" is not in the neurons anyway, but rather is in the way they interact.  If you took all the same parts of a person and scrambled them somehow without damaging anything, the person would nonetheless be gone (disclaimer: DO NOT try this at home ;)

&gt; on the scale of a neuron, one couldn't say that a person would exist.

Given a neuron-scale, full-human-intelligence being, I doubt this is true.  Otherwise, by the same logic we wouldn't be able to say that a planet exists, or an ecosystem.

&gt; the ten people don't even have to say that they are Tim. They just have to follow some set of rules, analogous to whatever rules govern a neuron's firing, and something exists.

Yes, I don't contest that *something* exists.  Specifically, that's what we tend to call a ""group"" or, in larger cases, ""community.""  If they want to give their group the name ""Tim,"" that's their business, but it doesn't mean treating ""Tim"" as a person becomes valid.  Tim is not a person, Tim is a micro-culture.  And he's certainly not God.

Why have the shamans remained unchanged?  Clearly that is a complex question dealing with many unquantifiable factors, but when considering a sub-population, the collective intelligence of the group acts on the culture of that group and vice-versa.  

Shamans have been a good source of certain lead compounds in drug development, but often not for the indicated illness, nor does any of their other knowledge usually factor into pharmaceutical success.

So where is your test for god? You seem to be missing the point that I was a devout atheist too, but found overwhelming evidence in support of what we have known for at least thousands of years.

&gt;If you continue in a way such that you can not invalidate it with all possible tests, then you tend to believe something is true.

I love science.

&gt;The other issue is, time and time again, we skeptics tend to be right.

I am a skeptic too! There is such a thing as healthy skepticism, and probably unhealthy skepticism too.

&gt;You're just a wave of energy, crashing on the shores of your own reality.

Wooooaaaaaaaah, deep. Sounds like what I believe.

I think you have a fundamental misunderstanding of life, sir. You do not  run out of energy, your energy comes from life, and returns to life when you die. Food is life, if it isn't life, it isn't food. Once again, I am not the stuff I am made of. The thing that is me, is not my body, it is not my job.

In general it seems like an experience that would be incredibly fulfilling. After I began to think about this I read On The Road by Jack Kerouac, and although i understand that this is in many ways a romanticized portrayal of the experience, it still validated my impression that this would be the perfect thing for me, and i won't be able to afford hotels so i will need to be living in my car. Do you have any words of advice specific to someone who would be on the move while doing this? I really have no one to talk to about this, my parents would dissaprove, and all the kids in my school just wan't to go straight on to college. Also, is this legal? I still wan't to do it if it isn't, but it would be helpful to know. It really seems like nobody want's to take a different path these days, everyone want's to go straight to college and then get a job as soon as possible, fuck i hate my generation...but i won't get into that.

Ribs, shanks, shoulder pieces are usually braised. But also the meat of older animals e.g. mutton or rooster (although it's very hard to get a rooster nowadays and you usually have to pay a lot more than for a simple chicken... times have changed :D)

I really like braising. I think it gives you a lot of flavour from very inexpensive stuff. One of my all time favourite dishes were the braised veal cheeks in one of my favourite restaurant. Sadly the restaurant closed.","1272675976"

It denotes the incredible stupidity of the party, while still associating the party with incompetence of action, on the level of insult (it's time for them to all wake up. I use the term Demotards as well, I don't unevenly blast on just one party) - while hovering just above the socially unacceptably used terms: ""nigger,"" ""fag"" or ""fucknut."" And this term is magnified with a subtle, yet true analysis of the trend of the current Republican party.

Stop trying to convince me to stop name calling, as I find that it is to be used with a grain of salt, and modestly. I don't use the term lightly, and you'll not convince me in any event.

Personally, I think it's fine to debate whether bullfighting is ethical (I think it's probably not), cruel (it certainly is), or deserving of legality (I personally would have no problem at all if it were illegal), but you can't logically argue that it isn't art. Because it is.

And you have people picking. These are farmers. You clearly are that simple - the observers are there to observe the farmers and the IDF response. The action is a protest as well.

&gt;Forgive me for thinking the two are completely separate thing, but you're right - these do seem like professional protesters.

Now you are just being a dick.

&gt;But that's not the argument we were talking about when you brought this link to the video, is it? I wanted you to show me when Palestinian farmers, while trying to work their land, are shot for no reason.

I'm sorry if you think someone shooting at someone else is not the same as what was originally discussed - perhaps your English is not up to scratch.

&gt;See how in none of these none of the farmers were actually shot, but just scared off?

So shooting at civilians on their own land is acceptable?

&gt;I'm pretty sure I haven't been questioning that fact.

Yes, it seems you do think it's acceptable.

&gt;If you'd read any further, you'd see the so called farmers tried to stab the soldiers.

I'm sorry, there is nothing except the claims of the soldiers that that is true - pity there is no possibility for the farmers to refute that isn't it.

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","**What was your birth plan? Were you able stick with it?**
My birth plan was to have as natural of a birth as I could. I ended up going to the hospital at 8 cm, which was too late for an epidural (or, so I was told) - so that went according to plan.

**Did you use a midwife, doula or OB? What led you to that decision?**
I used an OB - one from the practice that I had never seen/talked to.  She was awful. She literally told me I ""sucked at pushing"" and made me cry... I am a pretty optimistic person in general and she really was a downer.  

**Do you feel you were given the level of care you needed/wanted, either during the pregnancy or the birth?**
Yes - my normal OB who should have attended my birth was awesome. I wish she could have been there - but she wasn't expecting pre-term labor and was on vacation.  Had I been full-term, she would have delivered me.

**What was your partner's role in the birth? Did they assist in the delivery or just stand by? Did they faint or have to leave the room (for one reason or another)?**
My husband was great.  His mom had 5 other kids and he was there for all of them - he knew more about the whole process than I did for sure.

**Was your birth natural or did you use drugs? Did you have a c-section or induction? Was this by choice?**
I wasn't really aware I was in labor when I went into the hospital.  They checked me when I walked in and I was at 8 cm - which was too late for an epidural at that hospital.  I planned on not using an epidural anyway, so it was alright.

**Do you feel you were misinformed about any aspect of pregnancy or birth (either by friends/family or professionals)? Also, do you feel you were pressured into anything in the process (c-section, drugs, etc)?**
The nurses that were there when I walked in started trying to push for an epidural without checking me - I asked to be checked first and after they found out I was pretty much ready to push, that option went away.  My mom also had both me and my brother naturally, and said if she could do it then I could do it - if you can call that pressuring.

**If you had been sexually abused, do you feel that birth was a healing process or did it make it more difficult/bring back those memories?**
Not applicable. 

**Did you experience any complications (either with the baby or yourself)?**
Oh yes.  Everything was going fine up until about 34 weeks, when I went into preterm labor. I wasn't feeling well, and my husband was out of town for a long time - so my sister-in-law decided I should be safe rather than sorry and go in and get checked.  When I went in, I was at 3 cm, with what they call a ""bulging bag"" and having off-the-chart contractions.  The RN couldn't believe I wasn't screaming - I told her I just thought the baby was stretching... a lot.  They gave me terbutaline (which pretty much gives you a panic attack and stops your labor) and bed rest for a week at home. I tried to be super-woman and maybe did 2 days of real rest.  It was a mistake. I should have done it longer, but people were counting on me for things (work, babysitting, keeping the house clean). I was sure I wasn't going to be one of ""those women"" with complications.  I had her one week later and I'm sure it was completely my fault.  There's nothing more important than your baby - nothing. Jobs, responsibilities, house-work can wait - if someone tells you to rest, *do it*.

**After the delivery, was the baby immediately given to you or was it cleaned up, etc first?**
I did get to hold her for a minute after birth, after which they immediately took her to the NICU - due to her low birth weight and early delivery. 

**If you chose to breastfeed, why or why not? Did you have any trouble feeding?**
Yes, I breastfed until she was 2 - it was the healthier thing to do, and I didn't want to have to buy foul smelling/tasting formula when I had two perfectly fine boobies for her.  I did have some trouble at first - she was too tiny to nurse, so I had to pump and feed her with a syringe and pinkie finger.  Due to not her being able to nurse, I ended up with mastitis which, by the way, hurts like a son-of-a-bitch.  I wish I could have nursed her to begin with, but it wasn't possible.

**How did your body recover or change after birth? Were you able to go back to your previous size? Did your breasts, middle section, and/or reproductive organs change significantly? How do you feel about this change?**
I did go back to my normal size fairly quickly, no doubt due to the fact that I wasn't pregnant in those last 6-7 weeks when the weight really starts to pile on.  I ended up with no stretch-marks, which was fine with me - but I would have traded them in for a full-term baby in a heartbeat.  I haven't really noticed any real changes to anything, or my husband hasn't said anything to me.

**Did you experience any post-partum depression? Do you feel that this was something chemical or just a reaction to being a new mom and stressed/sleep deprived?**
Having a baby in the NICU was hard. It was really, really, hard to leave the hospital after going through all that I went through without a baby.  It was depressing to say the least.  Once she came home, I was just so happy I could touch her whenever I wanted without a nurse supervising or her in a incubator that I didn't notice any other depression. Sleeplessness was hard, but not depressing.

**Looking back on your birthing experience, is there anything you wish you could change? How do you feel about it overall?**
I wish I was smarter about going in and getting my labor stalled. I didn't want to be ""one of those women"" who go in every time the baby moved, so I tried to tough it out at home. I should have gone in and not cared what people thought about me.  I learned its okay to be scared. I learned that it doesn't matter what people think of you - if you have any concerns, *go in - get checked*.  Its what they are there for. You don't have to be tough every second.  If I would have known what I know now, I would never have walked in the hospital at 8 cm trying to act like everything was normal. 
I guess I didn't feel good about my labor - but the outcome was beautiful.  She had no lasting effects that a lot of early babies have (bad vision, learning problems), she's perfect - I'm very fortunate for that.

What does it mean, what's the point of the society we live in and keep striving for 'better' and more when all it does is make us more miserable.  There's lots of thoughts very similar to what you articulated that run through my head, more and more lately... I have yet to put it all together though... but it's there, swirling around.  

You are doing (and have done already) what a lot of people dream about.  There are a lot who have gone before you - you aren't the first, and you're definately not the last.  But it does take a lot of courage and inner strength to even begin at all.  I think you'll have a very profound journey with yourself and you'll find your truth.  Just know when to let go, and when to reign yourself back in (don't go off the deep end... ever seen 'Into the Wild'?)  

And your true friends will always be there for you, no matter the distance that separates you.  I think you'll also learn a lot about others in your process, and a lot of it will be shocking - some will shock you by being there for you in ways you couldn't imagine, and others will shock you by not being there in the least when you thought you could count on them.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Dude, you sound like you think you're way better than most others you meet. Want some advice? Get the fuck over yourself. Seriously. 

That's the short end of it, here's the long end. 

I've got a small group of what I would consider ""close"" friends. Maybe 6-8 of my buddies that I would do anything for, and I know they would do anything for me. Here's the thing, though. Some of them aren't anywhere near as intelligent as I am, so I can't talk to them about something I read in a scientific journal, or the new shit about particle physics I just learned. Some of them aren't as social as I am, and as such, they don't want to go out to a bar, or party, or just meet new people. Some of them don't have a lot of money, and therefore won't ever go out to dinner with me or grab a beer at a pub so they don't have to spend the cash. 

But you know what? They're all *damn good people,* and not despite, but because of their flaws. If you can even call them flaws. Those attributes are what make my friends who they are, and no matter what, I can *always* learn something from them. You're no motherfucking Einstein or Hawking, so you can learn something from just about anyone. And I'd be willing to bet that both Albert and Stephen wouldn't turn down a good conversation because someone isn't as smart as them, or didn't share every world view they had. 

Beyond that, well, when someone is bitching about professor so-and-so giving homework or a shitty assignment, guess what? They're fucking bonding with you, jackass! Or at least trying to. They're finding something they have in common with you to talk about, to start a conversations, and to get to know you better. That's how people connect at first, by finding a common ground and building from there. Don't be such a pretentious fuck. 

You are not some golden fucking god that is better than everyone. Sorry, but you're not a badass, you seem more like an asshole to me. Humble yourself, and then you'll be a badass. Don't fault people because they aren't just like you, because you're not any better or worse than they are. Welcome them in to your life, learn from them, and teach them, and grow with them. Don't be some douchebag tool fuckstick that thinks he's better than everyone else. No one likes that shit.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I'm sure a lot of what I'm about to say has already been said, but there are a TON of posts on here and I'm on my way out the door. I work at a school, so here's the best I can offer.

Call your financial aid officer from school. Since you're under the age of 24 you are considered, by the government, to be a dependent. The only ways around this are if you were a ward of the court (don't have enough time to do this before you turn 18), were in the military, are married or have a kid. Because you're a dependent, the government gives you less money since they think your parents can help you. You CAN get a professional judgment from the school so that you'll be considered an independent and get more aid. This usually involves getting a letter from 3 people in your life (teacher, guidance counselor, mentor, etc) stating why your parents won't help you. I realize this means telling more people about your personal situation, but no matter how awkward it is, it will be worth it. Ask the financial aid officer what the letters need to state exactly and who would be the best people to use. Sorry that I don't know more details about this. There is also a way to somehow prove that you're in danger of becoming homeless, which results in more aid, but I'm not 100% sure how this works.

SO moral of the story: talk to your financial aid officer. They even helped a friend of mine when her parents had to send her sister to drug rehab and could no longer help her with paying for school. In this case, the F.A.O. found more scholarships within the school for her. 

As far as community colleges go...it's a great way to get started but there are some things you need to be mindful of. Most CCs can only get you to an Associates degree, you need a Bachelor's...especially in this economy. Therefore, you will need to transfer from the CC to a university. Transfer of Credit is difficult and you normally won't get all the credits you took, usually it's about half (sorry to say). Reason being: when the new school evaluates it they will see if the content from the cc matches theirs; even from one regionally accredited school to another, what are the odds it's going to be that similar? Here's the trick: there are some CCs that link up with a university, so you can take your first 2 yrs there and then transfer everything fully to the universities Bachelor's program. Sounds like you've found this, just make triple sure that this is actually the case. 

You want a regionally accredited school no matter what, so this way you have a better chance of transferring credit. 

Check out www.fastweb.com and www.schoolsoup.com for scholarships, most require you to do something like write a paper so write your little heart out and see what you can get. 

I hope this helps, if there's anything else I can do let me know. I'm very impressed with your strength and mature attitude about this, it will certainly get you far. Might want to consider therapy, but not for being gay, you may need to talk with someone about what your parents are doing. This kind of thing can add a lot of stress/emotional baggage to your life without you realizing it (daughter of a deadbeat father here). Once you get the school problem solved you'll be able to speak with the college's counselors and I strongly recommend doing so. Hang in there!","1272676279"

"canada","t5_2qh68","With respect to tax burdens, here is a 2010 income tax calculator that will show a breakdown by province.

http://www.ey.com/CA/en/Services/Tax/Tax-Calculators-2010-Personal-Tax

The other thing to note is that Alberta is the only province without some form of provincial sales tax (though we still have the 5% GST).

Alberta is your best bet as far as libertarianism goes.  While other provincial governments are scrambling to appease various lobby groups by adding stuff to their educational curriculums, Alberta is amending its human rights code to give parents the right to opt their children out of any discussion (not just class, but discussion) on religion, sex or sexual orientation.  If teachers fail to get permission before discussing this stuff they can be fined.

Calgary has the most hours of sunshine of any city in Canada.  Fair warning, we get a sampling of prairie winters here.  Sometimes we are saved by chinooks, other times we aren't.  Be prepared for a -25.6 F day...not including the windchill which only makes it worse.

Summers are moderate, usually highs in the 70's and 80's.  The spring and autumn can be very mild or feel more winterlike depending on the year.

On that note, start boning up on metric...this was a freebie. :)

It is also very dry here.

Sailing is a write-off...well, that isn't entirely true, but I wouldn't want to give you false hope on that.  There are lakes around Alberta, you can find better ones in the interior of BC (which you can get to for weekends) but no ocean.

Calgary allegedly has an IT industry, but I work in the energy sector and that is the lifeblood of this city and province.  Someone else could better advise you on IT jobs here.

On that note, when energy prices are high, Calgary is booming.  Before 2008 our unemployment rate was around 3% (ie. everyone who wanted a job had one, heck we were bringing in Mexicans to fill positions).  Last unemployment numbers are from February with Calgary having a 7.2% unemployment rate and Alberta in general having a 6.6% unemployment rate...I'm not sure the jobs are coming back yet and while everybody talks about our oil, it is our natural gas that pays the bills and that commodity is still a bit low to be profitable for most companies.

I'm not sure how well SF to Calgary translates culturally.  While we are libertarian, we are also conservative.  We have no ocean, are very dry, very cold in the winter with snow and ice and we don't have a terribly large arts scene.  In my mind, a better transition might be to Vancouver.

Good luck!","1272676342"

Illegal immigrant crime actually does exist ( gasp!), As does the 'la raza' anti-american government ideal. in fact it's very popular on college campuses. Many libs would say it's only teaching about heritage and culture, but that's like saying the KKK just teaches peaceful history and pride. Any classes that only encourage one type of student to attend should be banned. You can learn culture without rhetoric.

To answer your original question, anything can look batshit insane from a distance without context. Arizona has passed many things all at once it seems: Open carry, Illegal immigrant crackdown, and now this ethnic studies thing. 

[Here](http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/news/articles/0113chandlerrapist0113.html) is a good example of what Arizona people have to put up with in recent times. I lived in AZ while this was going on, people were scarred shitless.

"gaming","t5_2qh03","&gt;Yeah, I would agree with that. Although personally I prefer to play a wider range of games instead of a single genre over and over again, so I'd still prefer them to actually make different types of games. Ultimately speaking I want to always play games that have a fairly significant ""different"" feel to them. For example, the Quake series and the CoD series are both shooters and share many genre similarities, but are much more different than say two CoD games or two Quake games.

Yes, this is a genuine need.  But how should the free market service this need?  That's the question.

In my opinion, if a company does one thing well, it should stick to doing that thing.  Let other companies arise to bring forth major innovations.  So your desire to play significantly different games, in my opinion, is better served by the formation of new companies, rather than by having, say Blizzard, stick its nose into new and unexplored genres.

That publishers don't want to take risks is definitely bad.  But you can't blame game devs for doing what they do well, can you?  If a new company comes up with a brand new, very innovative gameplay, it's up to the publisher to recognize the new genius.

Where are the independent game companies?  id, Epic, all those guys were indie companies at some point.  Where is the new id?  Where is the new Epic?  Modern indies churn out 95% trash by focusing on innovations that are pure fluff, like having all guys walk on their ears instead of legs, and like having guns shoot rubber bands instead of bullets and other idiotic ad-hoc innovations without vision.

I think the indie market needs to step up to the plate to answer your call.  And I also think, established companies should focus on significant refinements to their games, and listen to their users.

&gt;Basically, I stopped playing those older games for a reason. It wasn't because they were bad or lacking, it was because I was finished with them. Trying to market the same game to me again is never going to be as appealing to me as doing something new and unique.

Tell you what.  I've had pizza, how many times?  Probably hundreds of times now.  When I order a pizza I know exactly what I am getting.  And while I can't eat pizza *every day*, I do get cravings for it, for the good old pizza, from time to time.  Same thing with games.  I'll always enjoy an updated and refined shooter, if enough time has passed since last time I enjoyed one.","1272676361"

Immigrants are not going to _want to_ stay here without jobs, so your whole premise is wrong for one. They've come here for a couple of years, leaving family at home, working shitty jobs purely because of the pay differential.

And for two, if the jobs are necessary, employers will pay more for them. If the meatpacking industry, for example, is built on cheap / illegal labor right now, and they have to raise the price of meat in order to pay minimum wage, then meat will be more expensive. And, guess what, since those jobs are paying a more sustainable wage, they'll be more attractive to current citizens (some of the 20 million or so current unemployed.) The meat packing jobs are not going to go away because of the going hourly rate.","1272676366"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","When I drink a lot I remember things, but once when I only drank beer I blacked out for half the night.

The only time I have ever had any sort of memory loss associated with drinking was a few months ago, and I didn't even drink that heavily compared to what I sometimes do, and everyone that I asked confirmed that I only drank beer that night. I showed up at the bar shortly before midnight completely sober and I vaguely remember the bartender shoeing me out the door because he wanted to go home.

The next morning I woke up to find a partially cooked, mutilated pizza inside my microwave. You see, I have a very strict no cooking on the stove rule when I'm drunk. Apparently I adhered to this rule and had decided to microwave a frozen pizza. From what I could tell it wouldn't fit in there whole so I just busted it up into a bunch of pieces and shoved it in. After cleaning that up I went to the store to pick up something for my hangover. While I was perusing the soda selection I ran into my bartender from the night before who informed me that I decided to take the long way back to my apartment. According to him he saw me wandering around by the docks at 3am. When I asked him why he didn't offer me a ride he said that he tried but when he asked I just shouted NO and ran (read: drunkenly stumbled) away. I don't recall doing that.

One of my heaviest nights of drinking was this past New Year's Eve. It started with  pre-party at a friend's house where I was downing jack/cokes and smoking a little. Then the bar hopping commenced. The first drink I ordered was a Long Island Ice Tea then I switched back to jack/coke. We did two rounds of Jager Bombs before moving on to the next bar. The first thing we did when we walked into the new place was order shots of 1800. It was here that I switched to beer as my drink of choice for the rest of the night. There was a pretty good band playing so we danced for a while then left for our final destination. We arrived shortly before midnight and I clearly remember going to the bar to get drinks, hats, and noisemakers for all my friends. We rang in the New Year and stayed until they closed the bar at 4am. In that time period I had shots of Goldschlager, Rumplemintz, Jameson, two cherry bombs, another shot of 1800, some shot that was supposed to taste like Bubblicious but didn't, and FIVE Lunchboxes. If you were to ask me about what I did, where I was, and how I got home that night I would be able to tell you.

TL;DR: Read the first line.

If it is your first time and you don't mind walking, the honest to god best thing to do on your first night there is to just walk around and look at all of the cool hotels. Some of them arn't that impressive inside, but some of them (La Paris for example) are incredibly beautiful. They model the interior so that it looks like you are outside in a quiet French village. I also recommend the garden inside the Bellagio, and the Italian village inside the Venetian.

- The shopping is pretty extravagant, and even if you arn't looking to buy, it's always fun to browse.

- Some of the strip restaurants are also very good and very unique. I would check those out too!

- There is always some kind of show going on, and they are pretty cheap. Pen &amp; Teller is always a good idea if they are playing right now. Cirque Du Soleil is another great one!


- Go for a spa treatment! Even some of the less fancy resort hotels have AMAZING spa treatments.

- Take 30 dollars and gamble. You might not win anything, but it is a lot of fun. 

- If all else fails, it never gets boring to watch drunk people at night. They are quite hilarious.


Vegas is pretty easy to have fun in. The hotels always go out of there way to make sure that you have a million and one things to do. The last place I stayed in was at the Southpoint (a modestly priced hotel off the strip) and we **still** had an epic assortment of fun. That place even had a movie theatre in it.","1272676386"

&gt;There is still a sudden and dramatic uptick in temperatures at the end of the 20th Century. Red line in the Wikipedia graph. If I remember right, McIntyre was saying that the uptick was an artifact of Mann's methods. You and I just recreated the uptick using only the instrumental record.

Oh boy.

You are describing problems that would make Michael Mann blush (okay, maybe that's a stretch), and yet you are apparently oblivious to it.

- For a proxy to be meaningful, there needs to be some data from that or a similar proxy that follows a known thermometer temperature record.  This proves that the proxy indeed is analogous to temperature and not rainfall or some other factor not related to temperature.

- When proxy data in the modern era does *not* follow a temperature record, then that proxy is known to be not meaningful. 

- Therefore, if a researcher has to fudge and manipulate proxy data in the modern era in order to make it *appear* that it's following the modern temperature record, then he is committing fraud.  He's leaving the impression that the proxy has a relationship to temperature which in fact it does not have. 

# 

&gt;Indeed, this is just what Gavin is always saying: why are people still obsessing over a 1998 study, when paleoclimatology has moved on since then (i.e. Moberg)?

The reason why the discussion has not moved on is because Mann and the Hockey Team do not have the courage to admit a mistake.  This is almost understandable, because admitting that mistake would be to admit that the 'science' behind the hockey stick was politically motivated.

In a normal discipline, Mann would either fess up, admit a goof, and proceed with his work, or if he failed to fess up, he'd be pushed to the sidelines of the community.  Neither has happened - yet.

Earlier in this thread you had stated:

&gt;Looks like the ""IPCC got rid of the MWP!"" meme is a result of dishonest relabeling of the graph by that Swindle movie.

[Hint: That 'meme' was the result of an email sent from a head honcho at the IPCC before the TAR: *“We have to get rid of the Medieval Warm Period""*](http://epw.senate.gov/hearing_statements.cfm?id=266543)

The MWP was not necessarily problematic because of it's high temperature, it was problematic because of slopes it would leave on the graph.  Those slopes, the derivative with respect to time, the change in temperature due to natural causes, were, and are still, a major problem which the models and current AGW theory cannot explain.

"WTF","t5_2qh61","I heard a radio personality pretty much say the same thing to a related study today...same ending...""blame the parents""

Now while I agree parenting has taken a hit, just from my own observations from one generation to the next, I can't simplify the blame game quite so easily.

This is why:

'blaming' the parents doesn't fix any sort of problem, it just ends the discussion comfortably for you.

Why do current crop parents suck you ask?
hrm, this is a toughy, not all do...

However, lemme throw out some talking points:

1. Since you were old enough to comprehend, it's been beaten into your head that if you don't ""Succeed"", you are nothing, of no value to society, and rate less than beasts of burden.

2. Considering the dollar's worth won't buy you a good coffee nowadays, it takes far longer to ""Succeed"", meaning most have less time to do anything.

3. Meanwhile, your kids are being bombarded with crap, from all walks of business( I won't say life, because TV and the media has yet to even come close to reality, cept maybe PBS ).

4. Most families now have both parents working ridiculous hours, not only to put a roof over their heads...but to satisfy all their needs as well, because hey...if you're bass boat, pool, lawn, etc. is smaller than mine...YOU SUCK!

I can go on and on, there are literally hundreds of reasons why parents aren't the same....even when they try their hardest. I see plenty that get it right still, and this gives me hope. These are generally those that make a very good living, and actively take a role in their child's development. Not many have this opportunity on a daily basis. That alone spells doom for great parenting. 

I tend to liken blame to garlic cheese spread - sure you can smother one cracker with the whole can, but it's usually wiser to put little bits of it where they belong, on far more crackers!

They also gave me blisters and caused my feet to overheat from all the extra layering and support. Having less support helped me build up enough strength in my ankles that I didn't need the extra support in a trail shoe. 

I suggest that before and after you run on the road you stretch your shin muscles. You can do that simply by sitting on the ground and pointing your tows forward as you lean forward. Then switch by bringing your toes back toward your face while leaning forward. It's also quite possible that you went too hard and too fast while you were on the road.

"food","t5_2qh55","I'm like OP, and I just remembered something interesting.

So, I generally have a low appetite and get full easily.  My mouth stops making saliva halfway through meals, and it's hard for me to swallow by then end without a lot of water (if I'm feeling full).   People around me love food in a way that is alien to me, and I think it has to do with the neurotransmitter stimulation they get vs. what I get.  

Anyway, one day at a restaurant, trying to choke down the last of a meal, I thought about whether the lack of chemical release in my brain might have to do with the way I chew or swallow my food.  Like, I wasn't hitting a trigger that most people do.  So, I tried swallowing differently.  Instead of making a small swallowing motion, my usual one, which sort of triggers my gag reflex, I tried clenching the back of my throat a lot more strongly and involving the roof/top of my throat.  I instantly felt better, and the food went down easier.  

So, maybe try that?  I do it when I remember to...

The state has a monopoly on violence. By advocating non-violence you are accepting this monopoly and you allow the state to take advantage of you. Non-violence protects the state because non-violence is NOT going to get rid of the state.

Thanks for posting!:-)

Your thrill seeking and reckless behaviour, as you put it, could be seen as the equivalent of people who do cutting or self-injury. It gives you a sense of control when you are the one that is deciding to do all these dangerous things, when your life seems out of control.

With regards to your experiences with meds, was there any of them that actually had a measurable positive effect on you? When you do have a negative side effect, are you telling your doctor, or are you keeping it to yourself?

The meds are only half the battle, the other half is you, and how you are controlling your mind. You are not taking control of your mind. You are constantly thinking about death, and your last days on this earth, but when you start to have these thoughts that is your cue to take control of them, and push them out with other thoughts. Usually, the meds should help with that process to give you a fighting chance, so to speak.

You are not alone, and there are quite a few things that you've posted that struck a chord with me from what I went through.

Now, I'll have you know that there is a difference between what you are saying now and what you said before. Before, you said that you would say that there is no God in *response* to someone claiming that there was. This sparks conflict. Now, you are entirely fine with believing and stating that there is no God (why you would want to is beyond me, but whatever). Like I said, though, that is not what you stated prior.

Now, if someone says directly to you ""God exists."" you are fine telling them that God does not exist, and having a discussion. However, you never said that this was a personal conversation between you and another person. In fact, you quite implied otherwise, saying that they only had to *believe* there was a god for you to try and prove them wrong.

Just like no woman gets breast cancer and takes the decision to have a mastectomy lightly. Sometimes you do what needs to be done, whats best for everyone including the bunch of cells, and it sucks.

Shit Im married with one child and want to adopt another.

I never ever want to make that decisons but if for some reason I have to Im going to take my mental health and the overall health of myself and my existing family over some cells. 

Intresting Sidenote: I never thought I could even consider abortion until I had my son.

&gt;Human design has nothing comparable to DNA. There is no genetic material.

That is a very debatable point. Genetic material is easy to define as long as you don't look too closely, then it gets messy. Dawkins came up with the idea of memes, but it has not gotten much traction the way he meant it. But ideas are comparable to DNA if not quite the same. We have templates for building things and ways of copying those templates.

&gt;On the contrary. Digital Rights Management is meant to restrict copying, while DNA 'wants' to have as many copies of itself as can be, regardless of who does the copying.

I was going for a quick metaphor, but security systems are a better analogy. Cells put up strong defenses to keep out foreign genetic material, human designers mostly work to grab stuff from elsewhere. It is still the same process, modify and test, but we cross-fertilize more.

Experiments do not prove things.  They validate hypotheses, or they refute them.  Validation is not ""proof to be true"".

There is no test for god.  It's not falsifiable.  There is no scientific hypothesis that tests for god.

There is no such thing as a ""devout atheist"".  Atheism is the default state.  Just like you do not currently believe in half-man, half-beaver creatures 3 inches tall that live under your bed.  Why don't you believe that?  Why are you so devout in your lack of belief?

Lack of belief is not, in itself, a belief system.  It's like saying my hobby is ""not collecting stamps"".

I'm glad you love science.  You aren't a skeptic.  You are a believer.  A skeptic withholds belief until sufficient scientific evidence is presented in a statistically convincing manner.  ""healthy skepticism"" is redundant.  I don't even know what ""unhealthy skepticism"" is.  You're probably thinking of ""pessimism"".  Very different things.

I teach biology.  Trust me when I say I understand life at a level deeper than you think.  I have a PhD in molecular biology and teach introductory biology.  Life is a flux state of energy.  You do run out of energy - it leaves your body and dissipates into the environment around you.  Learn about the second law of thermodynamics and entropy, and that will help you on your way.

""your energy comes from life"" makes NO sense.  Science has a hard time even defining the phrase ""life"".  

""food is life"" - what the hell are you talking about?  Food is chemical energy.  It's not life.  

I have no freaking clue what you are rambling about when you say ""I am not the stuff I am made of"".  What are you?  You're a non-linear, dynamic complex system.  You're made of physical things.  There is no magic ""life energy"".  Energy is energy.

"reddit.com","t5_6","Flash may not be the best technology for what it does.  One of its problems may well be that it doesn't scale well to not-computers.

However:

For a few years now, Flash has been damn close to the standard for interactive Web sites.  Sure, for many things there's AJAX or what-have-you - but Flash is _easy_.  Much easier than most other Web authoring methods.  Hence, a fair amount of content (and maybe this isn't the way that things _should_ be, but it seems to be the way that they _are_) relies upon it.

Perhaps in a year or two, HTML5 will have a super-sweet dev kit that lets a nine-year-old make sites that do all the things that Flash does now.  But for today, to not support Flash means that some of the Internet is inaccessible.

I'm not saying the stuff that is done in Flash is necessary or even good - but if people want to access it, they will be frustrated when they can not.

I've heard that one of the biggest issues is that without proper multitasking, if Flash crashes it causes the whole device to crash.  I'm not sure if that is true (and I'm sure if I'm wrong, plenty of people will correct me) - but if it is, it indicates the oddly backward way that Apple has approached the whole thing.  Rather than doing it themselves or letting others fix it, they make claims that it's not worth doing.  This is a valid approach, perhaps, but it's also rather antithetical to the way the Internet does its thing.","1272676699"

"reddit.com","t5_6","I was homeless from Oct. 24, 2004 until the 29th of June last year.
Most of the time I was able to find a place to stay through co-workers 
 ( I worked  a lot of pick up jobs - demo, mostly ) ; if you can find a secure abandoned building in an area where you can lock out intruders but not draw the attention of the cops, try to find one with a toilet still connected to the sewer system.  Pack your load in your car in such a manner it doesn't scream ""These are all my worldly belongings"" and keep the interior tidy. Keep a few plastic bags from the grocery store for packing out your trash.  Always keep your wallet / ID and most important papers with you.  If you sleep in your car at night, get some push pins from the dollar store and some dark curtain fabric from a thrift store.  Use the push pins to pin the fabric up around your windows at night to block the streetlights and curious eyes.  I cut a small hole in one of mine so I could always have a small ""look out"" to the street around me.  If your winters are cold there, try to find a pair of Carharts or thermal leggings at a thrift store.  If you for some reason cannot risk sleeping without boots on your feet ( sleeping in an area where you might get rousted or your boots might get stolen ) be sure to loosen the laces before you go to sleep so your circulation won't get cut off from your feet.  Apply NOW for the local Section 8 office...you will put on a waiting list for a voucher.  If you get a place and job and by next year you are back on track - great.  You can always turn down a voucher that you have waited for if you don't end up needing it.  However, because the current depression may continue for awhile , you should apply for a Section 8 voucher and go to the local food bank for basic provisions.  Also, go to the local social service office and apply for food stamps ( called an EBT card ).

Basic Necessity List : shaving kit bag /razor, scissors, nail clippers, cough &amp; cold tablets, Tylenol, toothbrush &amp; paste, Hydrogen Peroxide, first aid kit, a tarp or at least an old shower curtain ( to ward off leaks or for cover during rain ), moisturizer , Tiger Balm for sore muscles, comb, dental floss, small sewing kit, tweezers, blank spiral notebook, ink pens, pencil, stamps, envelopes

If there is a local community college, see if you can use the computer lab there ( usually for local residents, it is free ).  Being  seen regularly on campus means you can be in and out of the library, dining / break area or in and out of a bathroom to clean up  ( remember your teeth &amp; nails ) without drawing a lot of attention.  When you have a chance, check the local notice boards for college kids wanting to share a house and needing a cheap extra roommate.

Hope this hasn't been too repetitive.  Good Luck and keep us posted on your progress.

"WeAreTheMusicMakers","t5_2qmah","Here's a little bit of the deal with mic pres (and with almost any recording gear, especially as you get more expensive):

* Good sound quality is cheap these days. Don't take my word for it, try it: take a great-sounding CD, send it out of your audio interface through the line outs, and then back in through the line inputs, and hit record. Now play back the ""ripped"" tracks. (do this, seriously) Does it still sound like a great CD? I bet it does. That's your basic signal chain. 

* Now try the same test, except this time send it out through your speakers, and record it with the most accurate and neutral mic you own. Even an SM57 into a presonus interface will sound like a pretty good mono folddown in a quiet room. And if you replace the SM57 with an omni reference mic (even a fairly cheap one), you might have to seriously strain to detect the difference.  If you did the test using high-end reference monitors in an anechoic chamber you might need clinical measurements to distinguish between the two. So far so good. 

So what more is there? Well, there are a few things.

For starters, the reference CD you were recording is already a great source. OTOH, a typical singer or acoustic guitar player, for example, might exhibit some pretty drastic swings in level when you stick a mic in front of them. 

Let's say you're recording digital so you set your input to capture average *peak* levels of -12dB, with maybe an occasional transient or plosive that hits close to 0dBFS. So maybe the average ""average"" or ""RMS"" level has the needle bouncing somewhere around, say, -18dB, with occasional passages hovering closer to -24. 

Assuming 0dBu on the preamp meters is equal to 0.77 volts AC, your ""average"" -18dB record level is about 0.095 volts. Your ""low level"" -24dB passages are about 0.048 volts, remembering that dB is logarithmic. Assuming you would like to have at least another 24dB of clean resolution between the quiet passages and ""silence"" (a.k.a. the noise floor, and 24dB is not asking much *at all*), that means your preamp should handle signal from a -48dBu noise floor on the low end, to a 0dBu peak on the high end. (we are here equating dBu with dBFS, just to illustrate)

So to achieve that 48dB dynamic range (which is not asking much *at all*), we need a preamp that can deliver clean gain from about 0.003 volts AC, to about 0.77 volts AC or a difference of 2^8. Let's think about that for a second.

If we were to equate this to household 115 volt outlets in the US, you would need an outlet that could deliver 115V on the low end, and a staggering 29,440 volts on the high end. If you tried to run that kind of voltage through household wiring your house would explode! The wire gauge for such voltage would measured in pants sizes and the wire alone would have enough random movement of electrons to be a white-noise generator when connected to normal speakers. The transformers and power supplies required for that kind of stuff would make your whole house buzz and hum. And that's just with a meager 48dB signal-to-noise! If you wanted a ""high end"" 96dB SNR ratio, you'd need a capacity of over **753,000 volts** at this scale!

Now, audio circuits obviously operate at much lower voltages, which considerably reduces the scale and materials cost, but the principles are the same: a high-quality, high-headroom, low-noise audio circuit requires very careful, precise, and high-quality design and construction. A 1% error on a logarithmic scale of 2^16 (96dB noise floor) is a massive distortion on the decibel scale. 

**So what does all this mean for preamps/audio circuits?**

It means that carefully-designed, carefully-built, excruciatingly precise circuits will tend to perform much better at the extremes than cheaper, factory-stamped, low-cost, looser-tolerance circuits will. A boutique manufacturer who is willing to pay 10x as much in components, testing, and construction in order to achieve 0.01% tolerances might sound little different from a manufacturer who is achieving 0.1% tolerance when you are simply comparing one line-level test signal to another, but those differences might become quite noticeable when you're combining 48 tracks of dynamic source signals and noise floors. 

You should shop based on sound quality, not based on design philosophy (leave that to the people who know what they're doing), but certain kinds of very demanding source material can reveal pronounced differences between preamps that easily pass the ""re-record your favorite CD"" test:

* Big, slow-moving, current-sucking sources such as DI electric bass or synth bass will push a circuit's power-handling to its limits: some may sound ""strangled"" or voltage-starved, others may distort in pleasing or unpleasing ways (e.g. a fat, beefy, punchy growl versus a farty/blurty sound). Others may deliver excruciatingly clean and precise transmission right up the point of overload, at which time they may turn into grating digital-sounding clipping.

* A source with lots of complex, detailed and rapid high-frequency dynamics swings, such as jangling keys, might reveal a lot about sensitivity and accuracy. Some circuits might deliver crystalline, pristine accuracy, others might turn the whole thing into hashy white noise, others still might artfully overload and give a crisp, chunky but still bright ""loudness"" effect, without losing the sense of realness.

* Intense dynamics changes, such as drums, might reveal circuits that handle big overloads well or poorly, in different ways. This one might turn into punchy, crunchy ""big impact"" distortion, while another might turn flabby and weak. Yet another might sound just like it sounds in the room. 

This is why commercial studios often pay a fortune for a mixing console with high-quality input channels plus a bunch of different outboard preamps even if, on most material, one track at a time, it's hard to hear any difference.  

**So what should you do if you can't afford a bunch of kilobuck preamps?**

First off, don't sweat it. Your prosumer mixer or audio interface probably has pretty decent preamps these days, which are eminently capable of making great-sounding recordings (remember that test up above, where the great-sounding CD still sounded great through your own cheap signal chain?). The difference is that you may need to adopt a slower, more finicky, and more perfectionist approach to workflow (which is a good habit to be in anyway), especially with regard to ""gain-staging"", which is the art of making sure that every knob, at every stage, is set in the precise ""sweet spot"" for maximum subjective sound quality **THIS DOES NOT MEAN PEAKING AT ZERO DB-- forget what your manual says**. For example:

* Let's say you've got one of those preamps that turns blurty and farty with DI bass guitar. I'll bet good money that if you turn down the gain until the bass is peaking at -12~-18, all that blurtiness and fartiness starts to evaporate. This might mean a slightly reduced SNR, and a slightly hissier/hummier track, but hiss and hum can be dealt with downstream easier than bad sound can, and there are plenty of ways to add ""growl"" and ""fatness"" with downstream effects. 

* Let's say that you have one of those preamps that likes to turn fast-changing ""sizzle"" (such as jangling keys or cymbals) into white-noisy hash, and that the circuit simply can't keep up with extreme high-frequency dynamics... You might need to try unconventional mike placement, for example pointing your room/""overhead"" mics at the floor, or off-axis, and then EQing downstream to compensate. There is no reason this kind of approach won't sound great, and this is one of those  rare instances where sonic maximizers/exciters can be genuinely useful in terms of restoring high-frequency harmonics that were lost to the recording process. 

* Let's say your preamp doesn't like big, fast dynamics, and tends to sound papery or ""flat"" on snare/kick drum... (for starters, sample-replacement opens up a world of possibilities, but let's set that aside). You'll probably to have to work harder on stuff like mic placement, possibly using more mics to capture different parts of the sound and possibly accepting inferior sounds to start with and then relying more heavily on downstream eq, compression, distortion, reverb, etc, or ""multing"" subpar tracks downstream to craft, for example, one track for snare ""smack"" and another for snare ""boom"" and then mixing to taste.

* Let's say that your preamps begin to reveal a buildup of noise/graininess/unpleasantness when you get into higher track counts... the solution is to use fewer mics/channels. Instead of putting (or using) top and bottom mics on every drum, see if you can get away with one or two kit/room mics and a spot on the kick and snare. For that matter, a good mono drum sound is vastly better than a bad stereo drum sound, and I guarantee it won't hurt record sales. Instead of recording six tracks of backing vocals, try recording two tracks with 3 singers on one mic each. If you're of a mind that you need 4 or 6 tracks of guitar to get a ""big"" sound, try moving the mic a bit further away from the amp, or using delays (here's a hint: half the ""bigness"" of double-tracking is the illusion of increased loudness: if two guitars sound better than one, half of that is simply because it's twice as loud--try simply turning the guitar track up 3dB instead laying on more tracks).

* If your preamps have a narrow ""sweet spot"" of good sound, and if you have a hard time fitting, say, a singer with poor mic technique, or an over-exuberant guitar player between the ""too quiet"" and ""too loud"" range, then set up two mics, one further back from the other, and then mix together whichever mic happens to be closest to the ""sweet spot"" of good sound.

In short, **there is a difference** with the top-flight gear, but you don't **need** it to make great records. ","1272676883"

"Ubuntu","t5_2qh62","Actually, electricfoxx is answering with a strong ""NO"" plus extra comments, but although his discussion stemming from that is ok, the ""NO"" part is inaccurate.

Some filesystems, *including* EXT3, do allow such things; they're called extended file attributes (as opposed to regular file attributes like last modification time). But for one thing, they need to be enabled in the kernel.

[See wikipedia for a small paragraph about that](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_file_attributes#Linux)

So let's say you have one of those filesystems and you turn on support in the kernel. You still need some way to tag things, and some way to retrieve things based on tags.

I haven't done this, but I see claims that the widely-used Nautilus supports the desktop search package ""Tracker"", which in turn appears that it may support extended attributes.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracker_%28desktop_search_software%29

On the other hand, notice that part of the point is that you want these tags to move around if the file moves around, otherwise the tags could just go into a centralized database.

One problem there is that not all programs may have been retrofitted to be aware that they should save and restore extended attributes. Googling a moment ago, I saw some bug report about some version of ""tar"" that was not xattr-aware (don't know when nor which distro). For example.

With a centralized database, you'd know not to expect the tags to ever be anywhere but in the database. It's kind of twisted to view a limitation as a feature, but there's some pragmatism in that.

Rather than focusing just on the question of file tags, you might look more broadly at your ultimately goal, e.g. by looking through:

&gt; -- the US has no bases or troop presence in Israel and stores only minimal military supplies in the country (and these under terms that allow these supplies to be used essentially at will by the IDF). 

&gt;-- Israeli bases are not available for US use.

&gt;-- none of Israel's neighbors will facilitate overflight for military aircraft transiting Israeli territory, let alone taking off from there. Israel is useless for purposes of strategic logistics or power projection.

&gt;-- Israel is worse than irrelevant to the defense of Middle Eastern energy supplies; the US relationship with Israel has jeopardized these supplies (as in 1973), not contributed to securing them.

&gt;-- US relations with Israel do not bolster US prestige in Middle Eastern oil-producing countries or assist the US to ""dominate"" them, they complicate and weaken US influence; they have at times resulted in the suspension of US relations with such countries. 

&gt;-- Israel does not have the diplomatic prestige or capacity to marshal support for US interests or policies globally or in its own region and does not do so; on the contrary, it requires constant American defense against political condemnation and sanctions by the international community.

&gt;-- Israel does not fund aid programs in third countries to complement and support US foreign or military policy as other allies and strategic partners do.

"offbeat","t5_2qh11","&gt; thus it's too big a grouping to be significant.

Except ""significant"" is a technical term, and can be checked. And it *is* significant, e.g. for sickle cell anemia. The fact that it can be broken down farther (with gains in precision) within cousin branches of gene pools on the other side of the world does not detract from that significance. If you took a completely separate measure (e.g., diet) and factored that out, you potentially could show it's not about race. But subgroups don't cut the mustard.

It is also significant for IQ (at least if we're talking African Americans, and let's not change the subject. Obviously this isn't about Australian Aborigines either, e.g.. The vast majority of African Americans trace their genetic roots about 1/2 to England and 1/2 to Western Africa--not a huge variety of gene pools as you suggest). The question is whether there's a genetic basis for lower IQ scores for African Americans. The fact that things like sickle cell exist (and it's not a lone example either) shows that it's **possible**.  People are calling this girl racist for purely for pointing out that possibility and having a hunch about it. Perhaps her motivation is racism. But it's not an unreasonable guess for someone who thinks race and a few points of IQ aren't important (and that's key--we live in a society where small differences are hugely magnified, despite the fact that most of us don't value ability in school that highly).","1272676970"

    * Immigrants must prove they can provide for themselves and their dependents, and not depend on welfare.
    * Foreigners can be disallowed residence if they ‘upset demographic balance’ meaning Mexican immigration law pretty explicitly discriminates on the basis of race, ethnicity, age, gender and whatever other demographic criteria deemed important.
    * Foreigners can be immediately kicked out for misbehavior, criminal activity, or for falling ill.
    * Illegal immigration is punishable not just by deportation, but by two years imprisonment. A repeat offender faces ten years imprisonment. Falsifying identification documents or engaging in a sham marriage to receive citizenship are also punishable by imprisonment. Unlike in the United States, trials, hearing, and due process do not apply to illegal immigrants.
    * All law enforcement officials, including the military, are expected to enforce immigration law.
    * Citizens must carry a national ID card and register with the National Population Registry. Foreigners are tracked through the National Catalog of Foreigners.

If it doesn't pan out, I would talk around to many surgeons in your area and explain the situation to them. Ask if you can work out a payment plan or give some other service in exchange. It is also possible for a surgeon to perform the surgery outside of a hospital and use their own supplies cutting down on the cost of the actual procedure. This is provided they can perform a laparoscopic cholecystectomy (use a camera and small incisions). Though that means more equipment and training. You could go with an open cholecystectomy but given the nature of the procedure, it calls for hospital time. It does not hurt to ask doctors for their help. They are good people.

Her second trilogy, and unrelated to the first, is The Demon Child Trilogy (beginning with *Medalon*), and this one definitely deals with Gods and their intervention. Interesting shift from one trilogy to the next, now that I think about it haha.

In the beginning you heard the sounds of the machine gun from inside the helicopter (the microphone makes it sound like something completely different because it can't handle the sudden pressure caused by the gunshot), this was also a demonstration of fire superiority as well as cover fire.

If you watch videos such as this from the mountains of Afghanistan, you will see that soldiers shoot across valleys in seemingly random spots. They cannot identify where specifically the fire is coming from, and they cannot suppress them, but they can demonstrate fire superiority.","1272677103"
"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","&gt; It's done occasionally, for things that are impractical to know.

There appear to be a number of people on this thread that think that testing is somehow supposed to be reflective of the real-world.  ""Engineers don't work this way in the real world so it doesn't make sense to have tests that required them to memorize formulas"".  The problem with this line of reasoning is that tests are not meant to be reflective of real world situations.  The very point is that they are controlled environments within which the instructor is attempting to make a measurement.  The ethical point is not that they represent real situations or not...  The point is that everyone being measured is subjected to the same conditions, thereby attempting to minimize bias.  The problem with cheating in this case is that it makes the test unfair against those that do not cheat.  Saying that this isn't how engineers work in the real world as an excuse to justify cheating is a rationalization that completely misses the point. 

&gt; I disagree with equating cheating with any sort of sociopathic tendencies. 

Several people have brought this up and I think it's a valid comment.  Allow me to clarify.  I think that cheating is a necessary but not sufficient property of being a sociopath.  My conclusions were not based solely on the fact that he cheated, but his complete and utter lack of remorse.  Again, these together aren't conclusive, which I why I qualified the point with ""or at least have those tendencies"".  

Don't get me wrong, I do think your comments are valid.

&gt; You can argue cheating's importance, but it's clear that other people will disagree with you. 

I don't know if you saw, but this has also come up in another part of the thread.  The difficulty with ethics is that it's not a matter of fact.  The key problem with this (as noted by Kant) is that humans have a huge capacity for rationalization (which is why he argued for the categorical imperative).  Kant argued that if ethics were ruled by a hypothetical imperative, then unethical humans would simply change the rules whenever it suited their needs.  The point about the conditions set up by the test used as to rationalize cheating is an example of Kant's concerns.

&gt; your ability to memorize things that any person in the real world looks up from google or a reference book, has absolutely no bearing on your actual ability in the subject.

First, you state this as a fact, but I don't think it is a fact.  As a Computer Scientist, the more information that I have directly available to my mental faculties makes me a better Computer Scientist.  There's absolutely no question about that.  Constantly having to go back to reference material is a slow and tedious process which can interfere with the process thereby making it more error prone.  

&gt; On that same note, a doctor and an engineer are not a valid comparison.

I completely disagree.  Both Doctors and Engineers do things that are a matter of public safety.  They are comparable on this point alone.  Both Engineers and Doctors are subject to professional associations because of this. 

&gt; Given the variety of things an engineer needs to do, they will nearly always be looking up these sorts of things in real life (beyond the most basic forumlas), not be pulling them out of memory.

I disagree with you on this point as well.  To look everything up (or nearly everything up) will simply be too costly in terms of time.  I would argue that engineers (and yes, I know lots of engineers) do most of their work based on memory and use references only when needed.

Go to college, apply for financial aid. Emancipate from your parents because you will qualify a lot easier since you aren't a dependent/receiving aid from them.


Talk with whatever administration people at the school you can. maybe contact some gay/lesbian groups on campus because they will be motivated to help you.


Get a job now until you start school. As soon as you get some money, move into a cheap place, until you school starts, then rely on the financial aid for a bit. Your home is a toxic environment right now and it will probably get worse.

The ruless in my relationship are different yes, but when I even have a fraction of a doubt in my mind that it might not be ok to do something I check with my husband first, and if he says no it means no. If I do it anyway it violates the trust our relationship is based on and depending on how big the violation it might not be salvagable.

I spent some time shooting the shit with him, very cool.  The FAP name came about the second year of the picnics because no one wanted the abbreviation that naturally comes from ""Second Annual Picnic"".  Hence the abbreviation for that year was FAP2.  Hey, it was a more innocent time.  No one was thinking of the alternative definition for FAP.  The dorm between Baldwin and Haselton was simply known as ""New Dorm"" back then. They had not found anyone yet who wanted to pay lots of money to have it named after them yet.  The school paper, The Acorn was shut down (too many radicals) and the editors managed to sneak out a final edition, called ""The Last Cosmic Imploding Mind Fuck Issue"".  Among other things they posted a complete recipe for blotter acid in that issue.Man, I wish I had saved that paper.  
George Romney flew in by helicopter to campaign for Nixon and he was met with so much hostility that he stayed on the ground for about 5 minutes before fleeing from the crowd the came to ""meet him"".

There is no need for a polygynous system from a survival standpoint.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Excepting the effect of the global recession, mass starvation isn't really increasing. The proportion of the worlds people who are hungry is actually decreasing (though due to the fact that the population is still growing, and disproportionately so in the poorest countries, the absolute number of hungry people may be increasing moderately).

That said, the main reason that people *are* going hungry in some countries (mainly India and sub-Saharan African countries), is poor governance. We all know that there is enough food in the world to feed everybody, and there is even enough arable land in poor countries to feed the population, so why are they hungry? Corruption, inconsistently applied rule of law, and bad economic management by governments (especially African ones), make it difficult for farmers to produce enough food, and get it to market. 

Bad policy in the rich world makes the situation worse. European governments (especially France) and the US government implement a complex system of tariffs and subsidies that protect their (wealthy) farmers. The result of this is that food in these countries is overproduced at incredibly cheap prices, and the excess food is often ""dumped"" on the markets of poor countries. The cheap food is irresistible to the populaces of these countries, but it damages the local agricultural economies, since the mostly poor and subsistence farmers which comprise them cannot produce food at comparably low costs. Everybody gets fed, but the country never develops the ability to sustainably feed itself. 

The currently standard system of Western Aid to poor countries is also arguably damaging. Western governmental aid is mostly distributed through the governments of poor countries. These governments are mostly corrupt, and most of the money ends up lining the pockets of a wealthy, connected elite, rather than helping the people  of the country. Since it is in the interests of this corrupt political class to continue to receive Aid (which they use to pay themselves and buy votes), they have an incentive to keep the country in poor enough shape that they will be judged as needing more Aid (though not quite so poor as that the country would be seen as requiring a change of government through military intervention). They delay or ignore important reforms because they make money by remaining poor.

I have a few favorite TED Videos for understanding the problems of Africa (where most hungry people live):
[George Ayittey - a Ghanaian Economist](http://www.ted.com/talks/george_ayittey_on_cheetahs_vs_hippos.html)
and
[Andrew Mwenda - a Ugandan Journalist](http://www.ted.com/talks/andrew_mwenda_takes_a_new_look_at_africa.html)

Aside from keeping your desktop better organized, it allows for cool application-specific features in your dock. For example, Docky allows you to control Banshee from the ""Banshee"" icon on your dock, and show the artwork for the currently-playing album in place of the Banshee icon. I'm sure AWN has many similar features.

If all this leaves you feeling ""meh"", a dock probably isn't for you (choice is good!). But it's not just eye-candy, there are well-thought-out usability reasons behind it. And in my experience, you have to use it for a while to really appreciate it.

Edit: I just noticed you tried Cairo Dock. Cairo Dock is trash, just a million options in nightmarish config dialogs. It's the XSane of docks, and I can see how it could give you the impression that docks are all about looking cool.","1272677273"
"technology","t5_2qh16","Even if you buy an advanced engine you still have to deal with opportunity costs.  Let's go over those.

Opportunity costs arise when you have a finite resource, like time, that can be used for this or for that, but not for both.

Finite resources in game dev are time and money.  Let's say you have the payroll space to hire 10 people.  You can hire 7 artists and 3 programmers.  Or you can hire 5 artists and 5 programmers.  Or you can hire 3 artists and 7 programmers.

While the engine handles many things automatically, someone still has to draw all the 3-D models and textures.  So let's say last year the engine allowed you to have 500 poly enemies.  But this year the engine is better and the hardware is better and it allows you to have 3000 poly enemies.  Guess what?  This means the artist has to put more time into the models.  While 3D tools can interpolate some vertexes, the artist still has to put more hand-effort into creating a more detailed enemy mesh.  The same is true about textures.  As resolutions and texture memories go up because of better game engines, it falls upon artists to draw more detailed textures, and more of them.

So as you can see, year to year, the pressure to hire more artists goes up, if you want to push the engine to the max.  If you want max poly enemies that look good at max resolutions, artists have more work to do.  This directly impacts payroll allocations.  This means, if you have a fixed budget, you have to lay off AI programmers, or you have to lay off scripted event programmers, or you have to lay off engine customization programmers, or you have to lay off procedural generation programmers and so on.  You have to make a cut somewhere.

That's one kind of opportunity cost.

There is another kind.  There is opportunity cost in terms of CPU resources.  While the graphics do get farmed out to the GPU, there is still an increased load on the CPU to oversee farming out of the graphics to the GPU.  This means there are less CPU cycles that can be spent on AI, for example.  So if you have a 60 frame per second game, your CPU might need to spend most of its effort feeding the GPU to keep up with the 60 fps, and may not have much resources to do good and interesting AI.

So in terms of budget management and in terms of computing resources, there are opportunity costs.  And yea, high-graphics games can and do ruin gameplay.","1272677273"

From wiki:
""Chinchillas eat and digest desert grasses and cannot efficiently process fatty foods, high protein foods, or too many green plants. A high quality, hay-based pellet and a constant supply of loose hay will sufficiently meet all of their dietary needs. Chinchillas have very sensitive GI tracts that can be easily disrupted so it is important to maintain them on a healthy diet.[16]  Avoid chinchilla feed that includes a mixture; chinchillas may avoid the healthy high fiber pellets in favor of items like raisins and seeds. Fresh vegetables and fruit (with high moisture content) should be avoided as these can cause bloat in a chinchilla, which can be fatal. Sweets and dried fruit treats, such as raisins should be limited to one or two per day. Chinchillas also eat and drink in very small amounts, therefore, overfeeding is easy.[17]  This can lead to diarrhea, or in the long term, diabetes. Nuts should be avoided due to their high fat content. High protein foods and hay (such as alfalfa) can cause liver problems and should be limited.[18]""","1272677345"

"SuicideWatch","t5_2qpzs","Hi jsantos17,

The meds that you are taking for your clinical depression are not working. Plain and simple, you need to get back into the doctor as soon as you can, and get on something else. What works wonders for some people won't on others. The key to making them work is to keep your doctor informed as to the side effects.

With regards to therapy, they're not your friends, and they're not there to be paid to be your friend, but they are there to help you cope with what life is throwing at you. The fact that you're perceiving them as paid friends is your clinical depression distorting your view of them.

You need to change your mindset in conjunction with your meds, and that starts by you seeking out comedy and anything that is funny. The meds are only half the battle, and the other half is you controlling your mind. Get a funny movie, like ""The Hangover"" or listen to comedians like Dave Attell. Get yourself laughing, and that will start to change your mindset little by little. You've been so down and sad for so long that you have to do the opposite of that.

Your skin condition, is the medicine helping at all? What about oatmeal baths, does that help?

If you're uncomfortable telling the doctor what is going on with you, then just print out what you've posted, and give it to him or her. You won't have to say a word, and they'll know how to help you.

Again you've got no idea what you're talking about.  Corporations can exist privately.  Corporations that want to go public do not need to go through an investment bank they can do their IPO all on their own.  Google did just that.  What the investment banks do is provide a service.  They say to the corps that they can get a certain price for a certain number of shares, sometimes they even guarantee it.  Then they get on the phone and sell the stock to their investors saying they can get them a really great deal on a hot new company getting ready to go public.  They're middlemen and serve no real purpose.

It's so true though that the confession only helps the cheater, and helps them quite a bit. It's also important to know that having cheated affects people differently. Some decide to blame others for the act, while some are completely devastated and will never do it again.

In my experience, knowing which a person will do is almost impossible without them having cheated though. You may think they'd react one way, then they do the complete opposite. Either way, rebuilding the trust becomes one of the hardest things for the one cheated on to do, and often becomes the downfall of the relationship.

* Looking confident and aware is your best defense.  (Related point: Be careful after a night out partying -- it's not a great idea to walk home alone if you're drunk).
* Pick safer streets.  Good street lighting, open businesses, and lots of pedestrian traffic are good.
* Listen to your gut.  If someone is giving you the creeps, don't be afraid to go somewhere safer (e.g. into a store) rather than finish your usual walk.
* No hands in pockets.  If someone does attack you, you want your hands free.
* No weapons unless you know how to use them.  If you don't, your attacker can probably take them away and use them against you.
* Have keys easily accessible so you don't end up standing around fumbling for them for a long time near your door.
* If attacked, your goal is to cause enough pain to break free and run.  Knee to the groin, jab fingers or keys into the eyes, etc.  
* Consider campus shuttle bus / safe walk programs, if your school has them.","1272677415"

1. We're the only country that reimburses the grand majority of medical research that goes on here. That was $95 billion last year.
2. We have the highest medicine costs of any developed nation for medicine. Why is this?

Other nations have single payer. When you have one buyer, you can essentially set the price to pretty much a smidgen above manufacturing costs, and companies will accept that, because they're getting a nice, large order from someone they know can pay, and because they're gouging us for the difference.

We get double-fucking-dipped by the medical industry, and it's essentially our own fault.

It is really a matter of killing animals in order to save humans.  We already kill them for food.  It is a natural thing.   Nature is a harsh mistress.  Also, don't forget that we also come up with veterinary medicines through research as well.  

I don't see it stopping any time soon.  While it might be a nice idea, it just isn't going to happen.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I'll buck the trend here and just recommend to fessing up. Here are my reasons.

1) Most professors aren't dicks. A lot of professors could care less about the deadline, they just want to see good work. You might not get any points off, and you'll produce a much better paper with the extra time.

2) You give yourself time to actually *write a good paper*. There is more to writing a research paper than the grade. The idea is to get something out of it for yourself. What worth is a 3-4 hour paper?

3) Long-term ramifications. There is always a chance the teacher will realize you are being dishonest. Even if they are giving you a break and already know, they will still remember that you didn't admit to it. It might be important to keep a good long-term relationship with professor.

4) If you have any doubt, you are better off admitting to it. The mere fact you came here for our advice demonstrates (to me at least) that you are struggling with this. Might as well play it safe--at least you won't feel guilty.

In most societies there is some standard for not having sex with someone other than the person your ""seeing"" at the moment but its fairly ridiculous. We are designed for multiple partners which is even more evident by that fact that most people practice serial polygamy not monogamy. Just because your fucking them one at a time with some social ideal separating one encounter from the next doesnt make it any less polygamist, which is what we are. If you want to adopt rules in your relationship regarding momentary monogamy go to it but come on.

"news","t5_2qh3l","Life long Texan here.  Actually, some parts of Texas and the U.S. were purchased from Mexico.  Texas **did** win its independence from Mexico to become a sovereign nation.  Quick trivia: Sam Houston was the only politician to have been Senator, Governor, and President.  Governor of Tennessee, President of Texas twice, Senator of Texas to the U.S. Congress, and Governor of Texas.

But, in the Mexican-American War the U.S. invaded Mexico and won control of about half the territory of Mexico, up to about Mexico City.  With Santa Anna between a rock and a hard place, Mexico signed the [Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Guadalupe_Hidalgo) which basically exchanged about US$10 million (equivalent to $260 million today)  to Mexico in exchange for parts of the modern-day U.S. states of Colorado, Arizona, New Mexico and Wyoming, as well as the whole of California, Nevada, Utah.  The U.S. gave Mexico back some of its land to where the borders are today.

Now, if you want to undo all of that, the U.S. will take back it's money (with interest) and take back the land if gave to Mexico and we can make better use of Mexico's natural resources than they can themselves.","1272677536"

Those who were driven away by force were joined by those seeking better lands to cultivate their bountiful herbs.  After many long nights and bong rips, a beacon of hope descended from the sky.  The treeple were amazed as the friendly alien with no name bestowed upon them a sacred fruit.  He said to them, ""Wander no more, lost saplings.  Take this sacred fruit, the Glorious Pineapple, and create a new land.  When you stand together you are a forest.  You will become the trees.  You are the Ents.""  The Ents were overjoyed.  They called their new homeland ""Trees"" in honor of the visitor's words.  The Glorious Pineapple became the symbol of Trees, often given as a token of friendship and fortune.  Soon after the close encounter, a peaceful haze settled over the new homeland of the Ents.  The story of the Ents carries on.

A good post and I have only one thing to add.

People are and have been aware of these issues for a long, long time. Time and again social reformers and religious leaders have stood against it and made attempts to turn things around.

For example, Guru Nanak, who founded Sikhism 500 years ago taught that all humans are equal.

Raja Rammohan Roy(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ram_Mohan_Roy) was a social reformer in the 19th century.

Mahatma Gandhi did his bit too.

The constitution of India explicitly bans such practices.

There were probably other attempts prior to 1500s also but my limited knowledge doesn't extend that far.

Many Indian know that practices such as untouchability is wrong on a moral level but still wouldn't want to eat from the same plate as untouchable.

P.S. Watch the HIndi movie Sujata starring Sunil Dutt and Nutan touching this issue. you wouldn't find a more poignant and beautiful movie with haunting music elsewhere.

He would be itching in class quite often when the outbreaks were bad.  The teacher somehow mistook him itching his abdomen for him masturbating.  this is **second** grade remember, he was 8 years old.  It was an unbelievably ridiculous accusation and they actually suspended him from school for it because the teacher called the principle repeatedly, insisting that she saw him masturbating in class, even after being given a written doctors note proving his medical condition.  Less than a month after that incident she called social services and reported that he was being abused because she saw bruises on his legs.  These were regular old small bruises that every kid gets from being a kid, not signs of abuse.  I myself was pulled out of class and questioned by the principle about the treatment of my brother.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","I live in America which is much more developed than Belgium, and America benefits heavily from immigration used to fill labor shortages. In fact, countries that don't have immigration coming in will generally stagnate. You must think a highly developed country is a place where people laugh and drink and be merry all the time, which might be the attitude that requires a country like Belgium to import laborers. Let me ask you, in an economy of high skilled workers, who digs the ditches and lays the railroad tracks? In Belgium's case, it was mostly Moroccans and Turks. Initially, it was about work. When their economy ran out of steam, they were stuck with their migrant laborers. Here are some links: 

[check the link](http://www.meforum.org/2107/europe-shifting-immigration-dynamic)

&gt;Moroccans who settled in the Netherlands and Belgium, for example, are mostly Berbers from the Rif mountains, not the Arab cultural elite[1] from Casablanca, Rabat, or Fez. These immigrants came to Europe in order to build railroads, work in the coal mines, clean streets, and do the jobs that Europeans did not want to do.[2]

__________

[another link](http://www.euro-islam.info/country-profiles/belgium/)


&gt;The main waves of immigrants from Muslim countries began in the early 1960s when migration agreements were signed with Morocco and Turkey and then at the end of the 1960s with Algeria and Tunisia. In contrast with the Netherlands, Belgium had no relations with the Muslim world during the colonial period. In 1974 Belgium imposed strict conditions on the entry of foreign labor but remained one of the most liberal countries in Europe for family reunion policy.","1272677650"

You know it's real when you miss them more and more when you're not with them; if you think that it wont work then it will never work.

I wouldn't recommend anything that wasn't.  The last thing you need is trouble with the law in a place where you don't know anyone.   

I've presented a somewhat idealized version of my time vagabonding because I had limited space and time.  It's not all fun in the sun.  There will be times when you are cold and can't get warm.  The loneliness of constant movement can get to be excruciating.  There will be nights when you are exhausted but you just can't find anywhere to sleep.  There will be scary moments and scary people.  It is a difficult, uncomfortable and uncertain life.

However:

You will find out what your limits are, and that's something most people never do.  Your preconceived notions about people and places will fall apart the more you interact with strangers.  You will find out that most strangers are good people, and you will become a more intuitive judge of character.  You will see amazing places that you never knew existed.  You will appreciate how truly *big* the United States is.  You will have stories to tell for the rest of your life.  

The advice: LISTEN TO YOUR GUT.  If something feels dangerous or wrong, avoid it.  Pay attention to your surroundings and use situational awareness.  Don't be afraid to strike up conversations with the locals, because they are the ones who know the best places to go.  Make friends.  Keep a daily journal or log and bear in mind that it doesn't have to be poetry--a daily entry can simply consist of 4 July 2009, Paonia, Colorado.  You'll want this info later in life, trust me.  Keep your mind occupied.  Most people are not use to so much completely unstructured time and will feel overwhelmed if they don't have something to focus on.  STAY CLEAN.  Arm yourself with information.  Know as much as you can about an area (local camping sites, stores, location of the nearest library/coffee shop) before you head that way.  Have a backup plan.  Buy a car charger for your phone.  If you can afford it, get a AAA membership just in case.

I was raised in a religious household so believe me, I understand churches all too well. I dislike church organizations that take advantage of their benevolent members. I dislike them taking credit for donating pennies on the dollar (if that) to causes while the rest goes to building elaborate buildings and funding extravagance such as the Vatican for a privileged few.

Folks choose to give their money to them because they have been brainwashed from the time they were babies. I have seen it a thousand times. I can barely stand it when I see my sisters have their 3-4 year old children say prayers. The practice of indoctrinating children is disgusting. I have seen too many people give 10% of their earnings away, and while the *members* of the church will help them in times of need the church itself does little for them in return. I understand it is their choice and they are just trying to do the right thing, but I know that they have been duped because I grew up in the same environment, and was too afraid to speak my mind until I was about 14 because the church is very cliquey, and when your friends &amp; family are all members of the church you feel that *you* are the strange one for not believing.

From the time we're born we're instructed not to believe everything we read, *except* for this one book. We're taught to accept it without question even though it's some of the most ridiculous stuff I have ever read. I don't understand it at all, I guess there is no place for critical thinking at church.

So yes, you correctly detect resentment in my tone. It's only because I know what the scheme is. L. Ron Hubbard said it well, ""if you want to make a million dollars, start a religion."" which he then did. And it still became popular because there are many people looking for direction and churches give them answers that seem to explain everything. They are naïve.

edit: If you read any history you'll know that traditionally churches have acted very hypocritically, and treated many people horribly while preaching to forgive &amp; love your neighbour (oh, but only if they belong to the same faith). In recent years this has not been the case so much because we've progressed and learned that such actions are intolerant, xenophobic, and simply violate basic human rights that everyone deserves. To say that churches are generally good is to ignore their past actions and put on blinders to the truth.

edit 2: btw, I appreciate the level-headed discussion on your part and am not the one downvoting you. Thanks for being reasonable in spite of my sharp tone and our obvious disagreement.","1272677725"

As for how these mundane things could possibly be dangerous (I still contend that they are not ideas), I propose the ridiculous ideas that:

-Zebra Stripes make it difficult to identify objects, and severely reduce the ability to perceive depth. If everything was Zebra stripes, it would be significantly more difficult to do everyday tasks, and driving a car would be suicide.

-The idea of making a coin round also introduces numerous dangers. For example, there is a possibility that when a coin is dropped it will land on one of it's sides. If the coin is then stepped on, the unfortunate who stepped on it would be likely to lose their balance and potentially be injured.

Now, it doesn't matter how impossible these situations are. As I said, these ideas are taken to the *extreme*.

On the other hand, there are people who cut all ties absolutely and do not come around.  Until one day when that relationship goes south and they come crawling back.  But by this time you'll have moved on, and will know what kind of friend he really was.  

My bet is he's just twitterpated and if you give it a while you'll get more face time.  It won't be back to the way it was though, if he has a girlfriend then obviously he'll need to devote some time to her, but he'll also want time away to spend with his other friends as well.  ","1272677796"

"religion","t5_2qh39","You are still missing the point. While it may be true that Joe did actually communicate with the divine, all we have to base that on is Joe himself. This is true for all the other Joes as well. There is nothing to differentiate the validity of one from the other. If I were to believe one (or more) ""prophets"" then I would also have to disregard any contradicting prophets. However, I would be disregarding them for an arbitrary reason which also applies to those that I believe. So again we reach this point where every prophet is just as valid as all the others.

The Rolex argument does not seem to apply. I think your confusion comes from your insertion of the concept of truth. Note that I never said anything about true or false; you inserted that on your own. All I said was that our own basis for determing the truthfulness of any claim of divine revelation is exactly the same across the board, regardless of who is saying what. The Biblical prophets are every bit as valid as Joseph Smith or the rambling guy on the street corner. No one is in any position to judge one as being more valid than the other. If one agrees with me on this point, it seems rational to not choose to believe any rather than choose to believe something that is entirely arbitrary. 

I don't understand why you started attacking me personally, but I am enjoying this discussion. However, while it is true that I don't believe that any of these people who claim to have communicated with God actually did, that is irrelevant. The relevant part is that no one can determine that. The trouble is that plenty of people think that you can. ","1272677798"

Well, we should have eaasily lost that game.  Milan had a fantastic squad and in the first half played some of the best football I saw that year.  With a defence including Djimi Traore, we didn't have much hope.  At half time, Finnan had a niggle, Benitez saw this as an opportunity to null Kaka and have Luis Garcia and Steven Gerrard to close down Pirlo who was starting off their moves.  It worked.  He was also praised for his half-time team talk.

Yes, we were lucky to win that match, but the turnaround after half-time was miraculous.  It was just not down to Rafa, but down to the whole club including the fans.  He worked with what he had to the best of our ability, it is not lucky that we got to that final and we won it.  


2006-07 Champions League Final
We actually performed a lot better than in the 04-05 final and to get there and play Jermaine Pennant and Zenden on the wings is indicitive of the transformation he has done with this club.  He also masterminded a 2-1 win away at the Camp Nou during that run to the final.

For the past two seasons he has to break-even in regard to the transfer market and has repeatedly had his hands tied behind his back in trying to move the club forward.  By getting rid of the useless Rick Parry we thought we could move forward in the transfer market after several signings failing to come through due to Rick Parry's arrogance and incompetenece (Vidic, C. Ronaldo, Alves, Simao).  Last summer, Benitez got told that we had money to spend, from which our targets were Stevan Jovetic of Fiorentina and a deal was in place for David Silva for Riera + 17M Euros.  These deals were all collapsed by the management team.  He is working under very large constraints.

We lost to Wigan away and won 2-1 at home.  I don't know which match you're talking about there but in general, this season we've been plagued by injuries at the start of the season and without investment large summer, we have struggled badly.  Yes, we rely on our big name players but don't all teams?

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I had a roommate about 3 years ago.. We'll call him Frank - because that's his name. Anyway, a good friend of mine (and current roommate), were planning on moving to a different suburb when our current lease ended.  About a two weeks before we were supposed to sign the lease on the new place, his parents called him and told him they were having financial troubles. To help them out he decided that he would move back home and help them. Okay - no problem, do what you've got to do. So - the issue is I now have to attempt to find a roommate.. Hmm where to go.. turn to the interwebs! Roommates .  com - okay lets give that a go.  
  
So I posted the place I planned to be moving into, the cost, etc.. got a few requests for people looking to sign the lease with me.  Happened across one guy who seemed to have similar interests and hobbies as me, so we decided to meet up at a local mall.  

We met, everything seemed cool, he brought a friend or two of his, and I brought my GF (now wife). We seemed to sort of click, seemed like good roommate potential - he had a steady job and was making more money than I was. I laid out the rules:  
  
1.) Everything is 50 / 50, rent, utilities, internet / cable.  
2.) No crazy wild parties, less than 8ish people was cool.  
3.) Don't do anything that could result in us getting any notices / evicted.  
4.) If you're going to smoke weed, or do drugs, do it some place other than at the apartment. Come home stoned if you want, but don't do that stuff at the apartment.  
5.) Clean up after yourself in the common areas.  
  
He agreed, and I thought - okay this is cool!  
  
Next week we signed the lease. Here's the first hint that trouble was lurking. The place he was currently staying did not have him on the lease because he was bumming a room from buddy for awhile.  The new place found out about this, and basically told him it wasn't a problem but that he would have to pay an additional $200.00 deposit. He agreed, and we signed the lease. When we left the leasing office he said that he wouldn't be moving in immediately and that I'd have the place to myself for about a week. Sounds good to me!  
  
I moved in, got everything set, my furniture was set up, including a couch, a table, a TV stand, and a TV in the common living room. Everything was good. 6 days later he and his buddy come moving his ""stuff"" in, drunk, at 3 in the morning.  His ""stuff"" consisted of a a queen mattress, a large Love-Sac (think large deluxe bean-bag with foam instead of beans), and his clothes. Yup, that's it.  
  
The first couple of months went by okay, there was a few times when he needed some leeway with his rent payment, I'd pay the full rent, and he'd repay me within a week or so. Same with the bills, not that big of an issue, I had spare cash at the time (but what happened to his steady job that was providing him with more income than I had? - He had no bills other than the place we were staying!).  
  
One day he decides that he needs to move his Love-Sac into the living room, to make more seating room, that's cool. What's not cool is sleeping in said bean-bag every night from then on, in his boxers, and nothing else. No blankets, or any sort of covering.  Especially when he has his own room. He slept in the living room in that bean-bag every night until we went out separate ways. 
  
A few weeks pass, and I come home from work (I worked nights, got off at midnight), I get home and .. HEY THERE'S A PARTY! There's 15ish people in our apartment, partying, listening to music, drinking. I walk through the living room, said hello to everyone, then went to my room and closed the door and attempted to goto sleep. Great.  
  
A few more weeks pass, and my GF is over, we wake to the smell of weed in the morning; we don't smoke weed. I stand on my bed, and sure enough the smell is STRONG and is coming from the AC vent directly above my bed. My GF can't stand the smell of weed. I get up, throw some clothes on, head out to the living room, it's even stronger in here, I then see his light on under his door. I knock on his door, he answers the door with joint in hand. Him and his buddies are sitting in a circle smoking weed in the apartment. I'm freaked out, because I don't want weed in the apartment, we can get evicted for that shit. I tell him this and he says ""oh, okay I won't smoke it here again."" A week later he does.  This time he and a friend do it on the balcony, in hopes that we won't smell it. (yeah, do it in public so the 3 on-site police they have watching the apartment grounds can see / smell it too!).  I inform him of this, realizes it was really stupid and stops.  
  
He constantly used my TV, never wanted to stop watching TV - jacked the electricity bill up because it was on from the time he got home from work, until the next morning when he went to work (he needed it on to sleep, even if the volume was all the way down).  
  
So time comes for our lease to end, I'm moving in with my GF - AWESOME.  A week after move out, they find stains and other issues with his room and bathroom, carpet damage, etc. The amount due for new carpet, cleaning everything, and repainting amounts of $400 after his $200.00 deposit.  I call him, let him know what is going on, he says he'll pay it and not to worry about it. A week later I get a call from the complex manager, she states that Frank never came by to pay the balance and that she would have to submit the balance to a collection agency the following Monday if it was not paid immediately. Because I am on the lease with him, this would affect my credit as well. WONDERFUL! I call him up, he said that he wanted to pay it, but didn't have the money. Seeing no other option I paid the balance and told him he owed me $400.00.  I left work on my lunch break, took an extra long lunch break to get there pay his balance, and get back to work. For the next 8 weeks I call him on a weekly basis trying to get a hold of him to give me some cash in any amount. After the 5th call, he stopped picking up.  
  
After the 8 weeks has passed, I give up. It's lost money now, but at least my credit is intact. 5 months later I see his car parted outside a Chinese restaurant - I walk in, in search of him I find him at the bar, he's the bartender. He first greats me with ""HEY!!"" happily, followed by a ""oh shit, I owe you money don't I?"" Me: ""yes, $400.00."", Him: ""I got laid off 6 months ago (fired) and I don't have any man. Me: ""Whatever asshole."" walked off.

**TL;DR**: Shitty roommate smoked weed in our apartment when I asked him not to from the beginning, had parties with tons of people, slept in his underwear in our living room, every night, constantly hogged the TV, ran up the electric bill, was late on his rent and utility payments, basically stole $400.00 from me. There was other shit he did, but this was the worst of it.","1272677854"

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt; They're not going to get amnesty - nobody is talking about that. Reagan was the last president who tried amnesty, and it didn't work. Nobody is talking about instant citizenship.

Pathway to citizenship = amnesty. The only difference is that they have to pay a fine to become a US citizen. This tells everyone who followed the law and spent years trying to get to the US (like my grandparents) that they should have jumped the border, they would have gotten into the country and citizenship faster. Its a slap in the face to everyone who actually followed the law.

&gt; And for two, if the jobs are necessary, employers will pay more for them. If the meatpacking industry, for example, is built on cheap / illegal labor right now, and they have to raise the price of meat in order to pay minimum wage, then meat will be more expensive. And, guess what, since those jobs are paying a more sustainable wage, they'll be more attractive to current citizens (some of the 20 million or so current unemployed.) The meat packing jobs are not going to go away because of the going hourly rate.

Im going to assume you are in high school, because clearly you have never had a job and do not understand how businesses work. If you truly believe that said meat packing plants arent going to eliminate a majority of the jobs they pay people next to nothing for when they are forced to pay people a real wage, you are delusional at best...

    &lt;link rel=""resource-package"" href=""http://static.reddit.com/resources.tgz"" type=""application/x-tar-gz""&gt;

To show blank.gif from the static content server, currently and in browsers that don't support resource packages, you would use:

But in a browser with package support (and assuming the package could be loaded?) you would have to change it to this:

Maybe a solution would be something like this, although I wonder if it might open up concerns about security or other abuses:

If you had 10mm to invest and you can invest in Exxonmobil (where you can sell it on the NYSE to daytraders) or would you invest in a private company where if things get ugly you cant get out of the investment?

A company looking to raise capital gets more money when they can list stock on an exchange where there is a diverse group of investors.  A day trader/Quant/Value/growth/momentum/arbitrage trader all have different reasons for buying and selling stocks, so they lessen volatility and lower the cost of capital.  If you start taking participants out of the market you lose volume and raise the cost of capital, and lower the rate of economic growth. ","1272677875"

Though I have served in other ways that no one will ever know about. I am also about 10 years older than you. My conscience can't be clear because I know I did things that were wrong and I didn't have to. Soldiers don't have the kind of choices I did... I suppose that is where a lot of my feelings in that regard come from. Anyhow, maybe a little immature... but so was I. Guess that is just being human, ehh? :)

And... having done things that I was later profoundly saddened by I can tell you that you get in the system. You believe in the mission. You convince yourself it is the right thing to do. Your life is immersed in this environment. Your perspective becomes warped. I even pride myself on being a fairly objective person. And I got to go home and do what I wanted in the evening. Soldiers live in that environment with far less respite. I hold zero illusions about current and ongoing military operations. I was sort of OK with Afghanistan and never ok with anything after that. Looking back I was probably not OK with Afghanistan, either. Like many, I feel we wasted the good will of the world and our soldiers lives for a conflict that could have been fought much more smartly.

Instead we have been gutting our intelligence agencies and politicizing them for years. Starting with Clinton. At least Bush put SOME money back into them, even if they were made halfway retarded. Obama is the first to run a balanced intelligence program. To little to late for many I guess. Oh well. I will reread your post and respond to other points over the weekend.

How would you like it if I called you anti-life because you're pro-choice? You see, it doesn't really work that way.

This kind of speech just serves to further befuddle the issue and make discourse less possible and less mature.

The real problem is that both sides of the abortion issue really aren't even focusing on the same problem. One group thinks that life is the problem, the other thinks that choice is the problem.

[Check out this topic on QI](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_tk6Wxkaj8)

If women are being forced to marry into these situations that should be wrong but the ""women will become prostitutes"" argument sounds like total bollocks to me. 

Is it possible to love more than one person in your life? Why not? I'm sure many people here have either heard of or been involved in a polyamorous relationship. 

We treat polygamy as some weird thing like incest but really if two women want to be married to one man at the same time why shouldn't they be allowed to? Or two men to marry one woman?

Yes, i studied 2 years in college and 1 year as a foreign exchange student before coming to work here.

&gt;Are you fluent? (if so, how did you learn + how long did it take)

Not totally, I don't know if I can pass the JLPT Level 1 exam but I'm kinda close.

&gt;How did you acquire a job other than teaching in Japan (as a foreigner)?

I went to a job fair at www.careerforum.net where a company found me and sponsored my work visa

&gt;What was the motive in moving to Japan?

Girlfriend was there, and I wasn't satisfied with my current level of Japanese

&gt;How do you like it so far?

It's pretty cool. The salary is much much lower than American engineers' jobs, but it's easy to live here and interesting

&gt;How do you feel you are treated in your workplace?

People pretty much respect each other and treat me fine, but I've heard stories where the sempai (more experienced co-worker) chews out the junior a lot unnecessarily. 

&gt;Are you living there for all your life?

Nope, moved here for work around 3 years ago

&gt;Would you leave Japan if a better opportunity was offered back here in the states?
Yea, probably, but not just yet...

&gt;Do you like sushi ? ( i do, a lot! )

Love it!

&gt;What was the biggest change for you?

Getting used to the company culture

&gt;What do as well as don't like about Japan?

I love the food, ease of living, convenient, anime goods, various technology, hot women. I don't like Japanese TV, small living spaces, low salary, and sempai-kouhai relationships","1272678044"

"MensRights","t5_2qhk3","The fact that an idea leads to moral corruption is not an indication of the veracity of its tenets. Its scientific underpinning is along the same lines as Darwinism and Memetics.

Darwinism, for example, is true regardless of the fact that antelope get eaten by cheetahs. If antelope could reason or express themselves, they might use the same argument you just used against Social Darwinism. 

But again, it's not that Darwinism is false, it's just that the antelope wouldn't think it's a good moral foundation. And I would agree with them. That's why I don't believe Social Darwinism should be an applied philosophy. It's something that is true, but something that shouldn't be used as an excuse for one's morally corrupt actions.

Let me attempt to use an invented analogy:
&gt;*THEORY OF HOME BURGLARISM:* Leaving your home and valuables unlocked increases the probability that they will be burglarized because they're easier to access.

It doesn't really make sense to say HOME BURGLARISM is a false theory just because you don't agree with its moral implications. It's still, unfortunately, a true theory. The problem comes when burglars say ""well, you shouldn't have left your doors unlocked!"" and try to use that as an excuse for their actions. You can acknowledge that the theory is true, and still be against burglars who exploit it.

**TL;DR:** Social Darwinism accurately describes how the world actually works. However, it shouldn't be used as an excuse for doing anything you want, nor as a basis for amoral behavior.","1272678085"

20 schizophrenia
10 suicidal depression.


Who do we medicate here?  Well try-cyclic anti-depressants haven't been discovered yet.  So what do we have left? We have some powerful early anti-psychotics which cause tardive dyskensia.  And we have MAOI inhibitors which have very dangerous and powerful side effects.  So let us just medicate the 20 schizphrenics and the 10 suicidal depression patients.






**Random sample of 1,000 persons in 2005:**

50 have anxiety
40 chronic depression
20 schizophrenia
10 suicidal depression.

Who do we medicate now?  All of them.  New SSRI's have such low side effects we can now provide medication for those with anxiety without the horrendous side effects.  


**Result**
As newly developed drugs have less side-effects the cost v. benefit allows those with mental illnesses which before would not have been worth the side effect of drugs to be treated.  This is far more of a pragmatic explanation than some contrived correlation=cause ex-post facto reasoning.  ","1272678137"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","&gt;most first world countries outsource menial labour to third world countries

that's two posts in a row now you use the word ""most"" recklessly. I wonder if you simply don't know the facts, but suspect your impressionistic opinions are more or less true, but since you aren't knowledgeable enough to know of any major counter-examples, you simply throw in a ""most."" 

the opposite is more true. Menial labor is imported since the nature of the work requires it be done locally, like digging ditches, laying railroad tracks, washing dishes, cleaning homes. Semi-skilled jobs, like factory work, tend to get outsourced. Also, only a few major economies tend to benefit from that. What jobs has Belgium outsourced exactly? I would guess very few.

I absolutely can verify that Belgium did intentionally bring immigrants to fill labor shortages. 

[check the link](http://www.meforum.org/2107/europe-shifting-immigration-dynamic)

&gt;Moroccans who settled in the Netherlands and Belgium, for example, are mostly Berbers from the Rif mountains, not the Arab cultural elite[1] from Casablanca, Rabat, or Fez. These immigrants came to Europe in order to build railroads, work in the coal mines, clean streets, and do the jobs that Europeans did not want to do.[2]

__________

[another link](http://www.euro-islam.info/country-profiles/belgium/)


&gt;The main waves of immigrants from Muslim countries began in the early 1960s when migration agreements were signed with Morocco and Turkey and then at the end of the 1960s with Algeria and Tunisia. In contrast with the Netherlands, Belgium had no relations with the Muslim world during the colonial period. In 1974 Belgium imposed strict conditions on the entry of foreign labor but remained one of the most liberal countries in Europe for family reunion policy.

Now it's your turn to back up your completely baseless opinion with a citation. the problem is that I've chatted with you on reddit before, and if memory serves me correctly, you're simply biased against Muslims. You want to believe whatever paints Muslims in a bad light, and that bias prevents you from doing simple google searches to verify if your biases have any merit or not.

And since you didn't catch it the first time, my asking you what a first world country is was purely rhetorical. I was trying to illustrate to you how outdated your thinking is, since it belongs in that us-them cold war mentality, but the comparison was apparently lost on you. ","1272678145"

"reddit.com","t5_6","Well, that does seem to be the perspective of America in general. And to some extent I do agree that homelessness and joblessness tends to be a drain on society.

However, there are small homeless people's enclaves that pop up in small towns every once in a while where people understand that it can be a lifestyle choice or just a temporary, enjoyable thing (I met a self-proclaimed millionaire once -- who knows how honest he was -- but he spent his days biking around with his dog and his tent selling self-made trinkets along the streets of tourist spots; he says he keeps the money in case he ever changes his mind or in case his health fails).

Still, I wouldn't rail against America. Most people experience homelessness as dirty bums begging for spare change on the side of dirty streets. That's going to preemptively bias people one way and lead to inaccurate rationalizations for their instinctive distaste, but in general it doesn't mean there's some evil capitalistic ulterior motive. It's not like they teach kids to hate bums in school.","1272678148"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","My gut reaction is that an ENT (Ears, Nose, and Throat) won't do you much good unless you are having vomiting spells or inflammation in your upper throat. 

Does your reflux still flair up? if so, try to get by on some OTC (over the counter) medications. If the antibiotics haven't helped make a huge change, then possibly it is not h. pylori. It is not until the GI can confirm via stool test or other means, will you be able to go forward. If it is so bad that it is affecting you daily life, go see a general practitioner or your primary care physician to get another script for medications (possibly back on H2 or PPIs).

There are small things you could right away to help you.

* Already said: Don't smoke, drink, take aspirin

* Don't eat spicy foods

* Try to RELAX and be calm; stress exacerbates everything

* Reduce the size of your meals

* Try drinking water or milk, instead of coffee or juice

* Avoid eating stuff that is overly acidic: Tomatos, citrus fruit

* Avoid eating foods that are hard to digest: fast food (fatty foods in general, minty stuff, alcohol (again), chocolate

* Avoid lying down, moving, or bend over (forward) after eating. Allow the food to digest properly in a vertical positioning. Laying down after 2-3 hours after eating (i think) is okay.

* Elevate your head if you are having acid reflux up to your upper esophageal sphincter and you are getting acidic vomit.

* Exercise more to try to lose weight (if you are overweight)

These things will all help you alleviate pain both in the short and long term. There are plenty of non-script H2 inhibitors and antacids (such as tums, pepcid, etc); plus, pepto like the previous post mentioned. One thing that might help is to take it 15-30 minutes BEFORE you eat. I'm not sure if I'm 100% right on this, but most medications--especially OTCs--*can* work well if taken before. People's body react differently. Try it to see if it works. 

Above anything, go see your physician(s) as soon as possible. This isn't life threatening, but still it's always good to nip something in the butt before it becomes out of hand. Moreover, it is hard for strangers on the internet give a complete differential diagnosis or understand a patient's symptoms/finding purely based on their own subjective descriptions on the internet.

"entertainment","t5_2qh0f","I hope they don't do Riddler. The reason Scarecrow and Al Ghul were the leads in 1 was because Nolan wanted guys that hadn't been in movies. He obviously went away from it in TDK but I hope he goes back. And if they have Riddler in the next maybe have him as he is now in the comics where he's a detective that solves crimes and lavishes in the lifestyle. My problem is that The Riddler is almost always too campy a villain to seem like a real threat. His most menacing was in The Animated Series where he built a game for Batman to play, which wouldn't really work in the Nolan universe. He'd have to be The Riddler only in name if they wanted him to be a true adversary for Bats.

Personally, since Batman is on the run, have the mob hire a certain Mexican assassin named Bane and just have a modified version of Knightfall. The reason I'd do this is that Batman's always fought his opponents mentally but whooped them once he actually faced them. Bane in the comics was a cerebral hitman who outhought and outfought Bruce Wayne, not just Batman. They could explain the venom part by having it just be a modified steroid that is highly addictive and poisonous. And I know Bane was in B&amp;R but only in name. I know they won't do it but it's just what I would.

And hopefully they set up that this Batman and the new Superman are in the same world.","1272678167"

The rest of what you say is attacking a strawman.  This girl didn't say all black people have low IQs, nor did I say that all sickle-cell anemia happens in blacks.  The point is race is significant in biology.  As in ""statistically significant"".

&gt; but as every race contains multiple and diverse gene pools

By the same logic skin pigmentation itself wouldn't be possible either (recall that we're not really talking about skin color itself when we say ""black"", e.g., see Colin Powell), nor would lack of an epicanthic fold (in Asians), Mongolian Spots (also in Asians), and a whole host of other racially-significant phenotypes. But *they* *do* *exist*, and some are on the inside (e.g. adult lactase production in Caucasians).

There's *no* reason why average IQ can't also vary by race (there is indeed apparently evidence for an IQ boosting gene in European Jews. That alone could potentially be the entire story.).

Diversity in a gene pool has little relevance to the matter unless one were to make one of those straw-man claims. *But*, even if it did, have you shown that African Americans have a diverse gene pool?  Why? Because there are a lot of groups in Africa?  Did they come from a random sample of African tribes? I think not (as many people seem to forget, African Americans are probably about 50% English genetically, due to the country's sordid history).","1272678376"

Somalia 5th of April 2010: The german vessel Taipan is being freed from pirates by H.M.S. Tromp.
The teamcommander of the boarding team is explaining the images that were recorded during the actions using a helmetcamera.

Our team got the assignment to free the Taipan of pirates.
There were 10 pirates on board and also 15 crew members who were safely locked-in downstairs in the saferoom of the ship.

Here the fastropeline is thrown out of the helicopter.
I'm shooting from the helicopter with a MAG to give covering fire so the pirates aboard the Taipan don't get any chance of firing at us.
Once on the containers of the ship my crew members also give covering fire for those who still have to slide down.
From there we went to the stern and the bridge to free the Taipan.

When we arrived we first arrested 6 pirates who were on the lower deck.
At one point there were voices heard on the aft deck.
We shouted to them and there were 2 more pirates coming.
Here one of the pirates is summoned to come down. He is also handcuffed and eventually we had 10 pirates captured.

With 3 of my crewmembers we went back up to the bridge. From there we finally went down to the accommodations of the crew of the Taipan.
We searched the entire accommodation to look for more pirates.
The pirates have turned everything there upside down; laptops were on the floor and doors were kicked in.
Some doors were shot at when they couldn't open them.
They were indeed armed, the have thrown everything down on the spot when we arrived, which ranged from RPG's and ak47's to handguns.

Finally the german captain decided to open the doors of their saferoom and come out with his entire team.
We brought them to the port side of the stern.
We told them what was happened and how we got on board. 
We got a round of applause, they were thrilled to see us.","1272678419"

By the time it's a month old, there might be half-empty theaters showing it, so it might be easier to get good seats at the last minute, but the ticket/concession/restroom lines are no shorter, since they are still full of people there for the newest blockbuster. 

Moreover, the longer I wait to see a movie, the less incentive I have to go to the theater.

Scan each location at appropriate times (when you leave, when you come back, after you smoke, as you prepare etc.) if something is out of place you can know as soon as possible what it is and where it may be. e.g. i know that I have say 3 pockets, what item should be in each pocket, check each pocket, each item is in each, then you have nothing to worry about.

This is the difference between paranoia and not getting caught. Being paranoid because you are disorganized *increases* your chances of getting caught doing something bad, being organized and habitual means you can rationally hide things without having to be paranoid. Cultivate a presence of mind and a specific routines and you will (almost) never fail.","1272678445"

"reddit.com","t5_6","No, you're trying to pretend words are more than just words and twisting what I said. My point is, was, and continues to be that the underlying beliefs *are* what we need to address. Focusing on the specific words in **no way** addresses the real issue. All you do is convince racists to come up with other words/euphemisms and more 'reasonable' explanations for their actions instead of admitting they are just being racist. So not only do you not address the issue, but you force racists to be more discreet which makes them harder to spot and address as such without them being able to hide behind plausible deniability.

Pretending words, in and of themselves, are more than that is the true idiocy. Fix the cause of the problem and the symptoms go away, the reverse is not true.

As far as freedom of speech goes, it is not in any way a straw man. Even racists have a right to express themselves and attempting to prevent that is short sighted and fails to solve the problem. As far as the government goes, you're the one who brought up throwing people in jail and used actual crimes in your examples of why words are a bad thing. Are you so stupid you don't understand how the two are connected?

I mean come on, you compared freedom of speech to not locking up child abusers. There is no fucking way you can be that stupid, it **has** to be deliberate.

I hate to break this to you, but using examples like: child abuse, lynching, job discrimination, and assault are the real straw men here. I'm talking about the right to use words and that words **all on their own** don't hurt anybody, you're making up false points about criminal activities that have nothing to do with that.

The fact that you can sit there, ignore what I've said, ignore the fact that I agree we need to address the underlying ideas (I disagree that focusing on words is the way to do it), and make straw man arguments just to turn around and accuse me of those things shows just how unreasonable you truly are.

Oh? I don't believe god exists. Any of them. If one day a being appeared in front of me and did something only a god could do - not something technologically advanced, not a trick - then would I still be justified in saying that? No, of course not. But in the entire course of human history that hasn't ever really happened, has it. Some people believe it did, they look to unsubstantiated claims to prove it to themselves. That's not good enough for us.

Today, right now, I know god doesn't exist. That little fragment I mentioned in the previous paragraph isn't relevant to today and I see no reason to acknowledge that tiny, miniscule chance in every single conversation about it. For all intents and purposes it can be *ignored*.

&gt;Nobody can know that a thing doesn't exist, and that has nothign to do with gods or anything else.

Existentialism. No offense, but ""yawn"". Mental gymnastics performed for the purpose of avoiding making a decision, nothing more. It's a cosmic cop-out.

&gt;Even if a guy says ""I just imagined a purple dragon, which doesn't actually exist"", I can't know that the dragon doesn't exist.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I have nothing to back this up, and am incredibly late to the party. Nevertheless, I'm gonna throw in a bunch of thoughts and hope that, if someone needs citation, perhaps other Redditors will know WTF I'm talking about.

I read recently that, although humans evolved as social creatures (obviously, as we are fleshy and incredibly vulnerable to predators and the elements for most of our lives, and thus need one another to achieve nearly anything; on another level, even those things that one might say ""I can do that by myself"" usually required a great deal of history, recording, and sharing to come to fruition. Of course I can make fire, but only because somebody else taught me), there is a cap on how social we can be.

The article referenced Facebook as a particular example of this; when the world was bigger, most people had something like 2 dozen people to care about. (For me, this is easy to imagine: I don't even talk to my cousins, and if something happens with them, my mom will tell me because her sister in law, that cousins aunt, will tell her) We had a six-degree thing going with many many people, but it was a branching web, and we were only a part of it. Now, with social networking and communications technology, we have a much shallower connection to many more people: instead of deeply caring for, say, 20 people, we kind of, sort of, care about 300 or so. {I have over 100 people in my phone and over 300 facebook friends, and recently was struck by how lonely I felt, considering I have zero closeness with nearly all of them}

We're constantly being told/reminded that there are so many people for us to connect to, but our experience constantly undermines this idea. Even internet communities run counter to this thought (""Hey, I thought I was the only person who liked ______ but there's this website and there are hundreds of us!"". Then you engage with this ""community"", only to take on a different identity when there; there are hundreds of you there, and all of you are lying about who you are - again, shallow connections with many people)

Another factor that might contribute to this ennui is far more innocuous: the idea of ""service industry"". I am currently unemployed, but have spent most of my adult life selling politeness and salesmanship, rather than any tangible product or particularly specialized service. If I had to describe myself professionally in one sentence: ""Always friendly, never friends"". Don't know how many of you feel the same on this, but it's one of the things that makes my stomach acidy.

Anyways, **parabolicity**, this was all meant to convey one idea: you are not (necessarily) crazy. We, as humans, did not develop into these incredibly connected (but also infinitely distant) people until the past 10, maybe 20 years... There is no precedent for the world as we currently face it (unless you count Babylon? IDK), and so we all feel a natural anxiety on the verge of that frontier. 

Ever stand on the edge of a cliff and feel the exhilaration of knowing that safety lies behind you, and the unknown before you? That's what long stretches of our lives feel like, possibly entire generations now. (I think the metaphor is accurate, as we're not entirely sure that this ""advancement"" is a good idea)

People are moral because cooperation is a better strategy in the long run (as demonstrated by game theory) and therefore is at least partly a genetically inherited factor.  Traditionally, morality has been more about something internal to the ingroup, and used to separate themselves from the outgroup (as evidenced also by the chimp ethical system), but since we humans are now a global culture, that is no longer going to work in our favour.","1272678491"

No, they are very different things. Read some history.

I get it. You're stressed about unemployment / the economy, and you blame the immigrants who have followed in your family's footsteps. _Every_ rich country has xenophobes with similar views. 

However, you should be mad at the corporate entities who have outsourced the manufacturing base of the US. You should be mad at the policies that have caused these people to become unemployed in their own countries. As long as there is such a disparity in earning potential between the US and its neighbors, _and_ available jobs, people will cross the border to fill those jobs. 

The jobs that illegal immigrants are doing right now in the US are jobs that _are not going to go away_ - fields need to be worked, factories need labor, yards need to be maintained. If it costs an extra $3/hr per worker, then that cost is passed onto the consumer. Name one product that would become unprofitable without an illegal workforce who will work for 1/2 minimum wage. If anything, cost of living would go up, slightly, if minimum wage were enforced on the bottom rung of the economy that illegals currently fill.

Disclaimer: I am not a mathematician, and I do not play one on TV.

** the odds of 901 truly random USA coins adding up to $100.00 is 2.422e-15**

here's my thinking:

901 coins with 6 possible values (1.00, 0.50, 0.25, 0.10, 0.05, 0.01)

This is similar to the math of dice rolls, but is a more complex set of combinations due to the values of coins.

see:

http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Dice.html

Now if we knew what the exact enumerations were for the 901 coins (how many quarters, dimes, nickels, etc) we could convert this to an equivalent of a dice roll distribution calculation for 901 six sided dice.

(penny = 1, nickel = 2, dime = 3, etc)

We assume random chance for the coin values

we do not need to find all combinations of coins that will generate this given dollar value, but finding one help alot, since then we can calculate the equivalent dice score for rolling 901 dice.

see this discussion of a similar problem

http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/68609.html

which is still a ""brute force"" solution, but using this as a tip we find

890 dimes = $89

plus 11 dollars = $11

gives us 901 coins for $100.00 even

using the formula of (penny = 1, nickle = 2, etc)  the equivalent odds are for a dice roll of 901 six sided dice adding up to a score of 2736

(we could do a similar calculati0n for 5 coins, imagining 5 sided dice)

**Now** we can use the mathworld dice formulas 

http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Dice.html

to find the actual odds

Total values range from 901 (all ones) to 5406 (all sixes) with a center value around 3153.5 [in a interesting bell curve](http://imgur.com/03lO1.gif).

see also this discussion: http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/52207.html

Using the beta dice calculator at http://www.AnyDice.com , I can input that I want the odds results for 901 six sided dice. (notation to use is 901d6)

for the value of 2736 I get the odds of 2.42249955265e-15 out of all equally weighted combinations of six sided dice, or of 6 equivalent coin values

**Thus the odds of 901 truly random coins adding up to  $100.00 is 2.422e-15**

Note: The AnyDice Calculator seems to be off for large numbers of dice, and so does not seem to be precisely correct, but certainly seems to generate a result that is within an acceptable error.","1272678537"

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","&gt;I happen to work in a bank, so I have a bit of a allergic reaction to customers complaining about fees and so on. It's as if they expect us not to earn any profit whatsoever! So what if some of our profit comes from fees? If it didn't it would just come from even higher interests on what you borrow, lower interests on your in-loan or from something else. We need profits to keep the wheels turning, we're a company like any other that needs to pay its staff and so on.

I guess you don't understand the root of your industry.  There are two models of banking.  

One model is the security model where you guard my stuff for a set fee, in which case the bank's profit is generally fee driven.  This model does not really exist anymore for the major banks, but there are vestiges of it.  Basically it is acting as a sophisticated mini-storage for money and valuables, this is what safety deposit boxes are.

The second model, and by far the more common one, is that you make your money on my money.  I deposit $100 and you pay me 1% interest, so the cost to you is $3 per year.  You then loan $90 out to someone to buy a house, a car or for a business loan.  You charge them 6% and make $5.40 a year.  You then use the $2.40 in excess to pay your costs, cover defaults and generate a nice healthy profit.  

It is so simple that people joke about the [3-6-3 rule](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/3_6_3_rule.asp).

Anyway that is the classical way to run a bank.  Of course they do all sorts of other little things on the side to generate funds and the fees have become part of that, but they are not supposed to be the core of the business model.  

There is nothing inherently evil about the [fee driven model](https://www.bankofamerica.com/index.jsp), but I don't want to have anything to do with it.  Instead I will stick to my much more customer friendly [classical model](https://www.emigrantdirect.com/EmigrantDirectWeb/index.jsp).","1272678576"

"web_design","t5_2qh1m","But that's not really much help, is it?

For one thing, ""CSS3"" is an umbrella term for a huge number of related proposals, none of which AFAIK has yet reached the stage of being an official W3C recommendation.

For another thing, the almost-support in recent browsers differs each time. Even if it's as simple as putting ""-moz-"" before something on one line of your CSS file and ""-webkit-"" before the same rule on another line, you're still duplicating information and writing non-futureproof CSS files (in the sense that at best these lines will become bloat that need to be cleaned up if and when the official CSS is standardised).

Then again, the W3C doesn't seem to have much problem with keeping CSS in the dark ages, because unlike the entire rest of the programming world that understands concepts like named constants and abstraction, the W3C powers-that-be seem [insistent on not -- in their view -- overcomplicating the language](http://www.w3.org/People/Bos/CSS-variables). Thus we get vapourware CSS3 proposals for things that about five people will ever use in our lifetimes, but common requests like making it easier to write themeable CSS are effectively ignored. Thus in turn we see the rise of tools like SASS, and once again the W3C is trying to hold the industry back while the individual contributors are the ones doing the innovating.

There is an old proverb: someone who says something cannot be done should not interrupt someone else who is doing it. Perhaps we should print this in 12"" letters on a poster and mail it to the W3C.","1272678675"

lol I don't know what to tell you man.

&gt;You're saying people are ""jumping to conclusions"" that this law will cause cops to racially profile, as if Arpaio's goons haven't already been doing this for years.

If they've been doing it for years, than it isn't the new law thats going to cause it. Its already happening and the new law isn't active yet. Apparently there are other problems not related to the new law.

&gt;When was the last time you passed through a border patrol station on an American highway North of the Mexican border? I've only ever seen them stop trucks, and brown people. Whites like me get asked if they're American and waved through.

I live about 3 hours north of home. Every once in a while, when I visit home, I have to pass through 2 (sometimes 3) check points. I'm waived by everytime. My mom, who has a very heavy mexican accent hasn't been pulled over since the 80's. But, of course, that is because we aren't very suspicious. Since I live close to mexico, most of the people they pull over who seem suspicious are likely to be mexican. Makes sense, doesn't mean they're racially profiling.

&gt;I don't believe you for a second. If you were looking for reasons to be against this law, you'd already be against it. You're either an incredible moron, or a super troll.

This seems to be the go to response for people that are having trouble backing themselves up. I'm not willing to just be against something simply because everyone else is. I need reasons, and none of the reasons provided (at least by you) have been any good.

To answer your question more directly, if we are forcing something upon a person then we have gone too far. At that point there needs to be some sort of negative consequence to prevent people from harming other people.

If we look at this from an unbiased perspective, its talented young girls dancing in a particular way and apparently enjoying it. There is no direct harm caused by this, though some may debate it has some mental effect on the girls. If all parties involved consider it okay though, then there isn't much of a problem.

I decided to grab a student loan and take a year-long intensive course in 3D art using Autodesk Softimage. It was indeed intense and the teachers were, for the most part, only good for motivating me to learn on my own. I decided early on that I wanted to learn character animation so I hit up every resource I could. Digital Tutors tutorials, watching actors, watching people walk and act while in a cafe or train station, all sorts of stuff.  And I pulled it off.

After school I took a little cafe job to help pay the bills while I worked on the demo and after a few months I got the first job. Here I am right now actually. I'm in a lovely small 3d studio being paid more as base salary than I did in that crappy video game studio AND I'm pretty happy here. It's got a real family feel.

To answer your questions directly, I'm an animator. It took me a year of school and a bit to get that first job (which is the biggest step after school.) And I'm living very comfortably (although I also enjoy being a bit frugal too.) 

Now, as is my experience with meeting people here in the 3D biz, there is no age at which point ya can't start out. There were guys in my 3D class that were well in their 30s and I'm working with them right now. I have a close friend who was a successful accountant before making a similar switch to 3D and he was 30 ish. Works in videogames now. My advice, then, is to do it. It's great here.

THe only catch is that to rent a car or some other things (like airline tickets) it can be required to have upwards of $2000 in your account before you can rent the car (so they can charge you if you damage it)  Really you can get by without one.  I am 31, have lived all over the US (not sure about UK) and I've never borrowed for anything except a car or a house.  I think debt is one of the most dangerous things in the world and it should not be used at all when possible and used VERY carefully when absolutely necessary.  I'm not shitting you when I say READ AND UNDERSTAND the fine print.  Another great argument for having a credit card is that it builds your credit score...  (US)  This is true, but at great risk of changing interest rates massive fees and fines etc.  In my opinion, if you really want to build your credit safely, buy a car.  Something around 2-3000 bucks.  Come to the bank with $2000 cash and ask to borrow $1000 for 2 years.  Pay the loan off early then check your credit.  You will have a significantly higher credit rating (if you have no credit).  ","1272678956"

People act like I am some crazy child molester because i found it funny to knock fun at this bear and throw it on a cake.  EVERYONE at the party laughed about it.  My kid thought it was a cute bear and we moved on... I doubt pedobear will still be around when she is 13 or 18... I do know if my parents had this story to tell me once I was in my late teens or twenties I would find it to be HI-larious... is it something i will tell her at 5 Fuck No I wouldn't.  People have made WAY to big of a deal about this.  I took my child out of her daycare monday because one of the workers was caught screaming in a 1 year olds face and pointing like she was going to gouge his eyes out... I wanted to bash her face in with a sippy cup.  THAT is abuse.  Not a pink cake at a pizza place with a merry go round and games.  She is such an amazing child and is adored everywhere she goes.  I assure you I know what I am doing as a parent and I am not shot gunning weed into her face and using her wooden spoons form her mini kitchen to stir meth.  Just to ease your mind....  Oh and I am not a fake, troller, internet weirdo.  I am this childs mom and proud to have a sense of humor.  I DO think it is funny that no one has asked what the father thought?  or is it just assumed that I am a white trash /b/ loving ( i still am not sure of what this is) single mother who lives in free housing since I would put pedobear on a cake?  To let you know... my husband loved it too.  He would slice a mans face off to protect his baby.,... but he still has a sense of humor and the smarts to know that this is simply a joke.  weeeeee!  I also find it funny that people are mad that I have posted so much on this thread about my kidds cake.  I have been told to get off the internet and go raise my child... 8pm bath time 830-9 books and 9 is sleepy town!  parents are allowed to have time to themselves too right?  or do the people out there with out children want to tell me how to raise a child?","1272678962"

Treasure Island has the [best skyline view](http://www.millervision.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/_mg_8688.jpg) (no my pic but this is pretty much what it looks like) of the city.  There isn't anything to do there but take pictures (lived there for a year, there's a little liquor store by the main road and that's it) but it's an amazing view.

List compiled for when my sister's bf visited from out of town:

* golden gate bridge (marin headlands)

* embarcadero (ferry building, embarcadero center then take the F line down to the wharf, it's a vintage bus line with the old muni that they had from way back in the day and it drops you off right in the wharf area)

* ghirardelli square (900 north point street)

* twin peaks

* Coit tower

* alcatraz

* haight

* chinatown (it's one of the largest in the US, take them to golden gate bakery for egg tarts, the cable car along california street drops you off right in chinatown)

* japantown

* the exploratorium

* academy of sciences

* lombard (Powell-Hyde cable car will get you to the top of lombard, Powell-Mason will take you close to the bottom)

* japanese tea garden

* golden gate park (drum circles by the playground, the playground has been remodeled and is nothing like it use to be but the carousel is always fun!)

* arboretum

* cable cars

* fort funston

* sutro baths (ocean beach along great highway)

* musee mechanique (mechanical museum, by the wharf)

Culture shock from going overseas is not going to help you adjust and on top of still getting to know who you are it very well might break you.  I was kicked out of the house after my Junior year of High School (18th Birthday) so I can somewhat relate.

In addition you really need to think about the long term.  You head out to Scotland and your travelling visa expires you have an expensive plane ticket or illegal alien status, plus no real education to stand on.  So take the other offer and learn from this experience.  Some of the worst days of my life were spent sleeping on a friends floor barely trying to make ends meet, you're being given an opportunity to stay in a state you're somewhat familiar with and go to college, take it.

Also file an appeal with the college you wanted to attend stating that you have irreconcilable differences with your parents.  If approved (which if you're telling the truth it will be) then that will drop your Expected Family Contribution (EFC) to zero.  This will get you the bare minimum of a Pell Grant for 5500 or so and with free room and board you can easily pay for your own meals at least.

Most of all good luck man, sometimes you get dealt a shitty hand but you just need to make some smart decisions, appreciate what you're being offered, and work hard.

Edit: That's bare minimum 5,500, you can easily get state grants, low interest and subsidized loans, etc.","1272679045"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Frequent traveler here.  I'm usually pretty laid back about babies that are just restless or earache-y or whatever it is that makes them cry, but I do have a few observations:

* Don't ignore your kid.  I don't get annoyed by noisy babies in general, but I do get annoyed when the baby obviously just wants Mom/Dad to play with him, but Mom/Dad is steadfastly ignoring him and reading the newspaper.
* Related point:  My biggest pet peeve is when, after landing, two parents jump up and start getting stuff from the overhead bins while the kid sits in the seat and screams his head off.  If two adults are traveling, one of you can sit with the kid and keep him calm while the other gets the suitcases ready.  If you are traveling alone, it's trickier, and I think your best bet is honestly to sit with the kid for a bit while the plane clears out.
* Think about whether preboarding actually makes sense for you.  I think it can actually be worse for families with little kids, because it takes such a long time for the plane to load.  The kid has time to feel cooped up and restless in his seat before the plane even leaves the gate.  If you need the overhead bin space, go for it, but don't just preboard because you can -- better to let him squirrel around in the gate area for as long as possible.
* If you're still deciding on tickets, go for tickets at a time (1) that works well with your kid's sleep / crankiness schedule and (2) when planes tend to be less full.  Avoid rush-hour evening flights between major cities, if possible - they tend to be very full with grumpy business travelers.  Mid-morning and early-afternoon flights are usually better.
* Don't expect much from the flight attendants in coach (e.g. if he's going to want juice, buy some inside security in the airport rather than counting on good service in the air).
* Might be good to have a blanket or sweater for him in case the plane is overairconditioned.","1272679130"

But Forever 21 shirts seem to be a little tight around the chest and shoulders so I would only buy if you're skinny. They typically run you $20 or so. 

H&amp;M is another good place to find men's clothing in general for cheap. But my main issue with this store is that finding those good pieces is like hunting through a garbage dump for a gold watch. There's a lot of really douche-y stuff to sift through to find those good pieces (Unless you want that douche-y look).

Express/Banana Republic offer very similar clothing at a slightly higher price range, expect to pay $40+ for a dress shirt in very fanciful colors. At Express the 1MX and 2MX shirts can both be worn in the situations you've described. Don't just get white or black, try on different colors that you can pull off. Most men can pull off blues, greens, purples and greys. Also at Express they have the big box sales every once in a while, you can pick up some good pieces for cheap. You can save even more if you have a coupon such as $30 off 75 or whatnot. 

On tucking or not tucking it depends on what you're wearing and how long the tail of the shirt is. If it barely covers your waist, don't tuck it. If it covers your butt, get a new shirt it's not fitted correctly.

As for bottoms it really depends on what colors you're wearing, if you're not confident in color-matching just go with dark slim fitting jeans. Match with black leather [loafers](http://www.saksfifthavenue.com/main/ProductDetail.jsp?PRODUCT%3C%3Eprd_id=845524446228317) (I'm not saying get that exact pair, but a pair in style similar to that would be good.)

Yes they are. The Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 specifically said that 

&gt;""Violation of the registration requirements can lead to **civil liability ** for the issuer and underwriters Sections 11, 12(a)(1) or 12(a)(2) of the Act. Additional liability may be imposed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Rule 10b-5).""


&gt;People are supposed to audit these fucks and make sure they comply.

And how do you think they ""make sure they comply""? Lawsuits and fines.

&gt;But under Bush, the SEC was essentially turned off. They didn't enforce anything. 

Yes they were. Which is one of many reasons I don't support Bush. But they were pretty incompetent even before/after that.

&gt;Thus now the only thing we can do is sue.

As previously stated, that's all we could ever do except in instances like Fraud where there *can* be criminal trials. But that's not regulatory agencies that do that. Occasionally when one or two people are clearly individually responsible for fraud they are tried as individuals, but not on behalf of a company..  Those are not regulations. Those are crimes for individuals.

&gt;You clearly have no idea what regulation means.

That's funny. Don't worry, you can try again when your opinion stops contradicting itself and you figure out how  enforcement actually occurs.

The regulators are incompetent, and that's the problem. The regulations already exist. Though the SEC is offtopic  it seems to have become our example of choice, so I'll leave you with the basic objectives of the 1933 Securities Act:

&gt;to require that investors receive significant (or “material”) information concerning securities being offered for public sale; and

&gt;to prohibit deceit, misrepresentations, and other fraud in the sale of securities to the public.

All the traders and bank IT people that got cut due to down times went looking for work in non-finance jobs for a while.

In practice they sucked. Most of the ex-finance IT guys I worked with were sub-standard skills wise, knowing only the market related quirks which were of no use outside the market. Ask them to write data mining software or multi-threaded search engine code and they barely knew where to start.

I did some IT integration work for a recruiting firm, and there was a general consensus coming back from all the recruiters on the floor after introducing finance guys to their clients. ""No relevant skills"" was the common cry, and ""graduates cost less and have less attitude"" was another comment I heard. 

At least one client of theirs explicitly said ""no more ex-finance people please"".

They work harder alright, but not smarter. And they only work harder for themselves, not the team as most non-finance people are used to. Hopefully if the market picks up they'll go back to Wall St and the rest of us will be free of them.","1272679311"

Roma - “Non avendo ancora ricevuto alcun riscontro dagli organi competenti, la nostra protesta prosegue con maggior determinazione, perché la problematica incide negativamente sull’espletamento delle funzioni del pubblico impiego”.

Con questa frase Antonello De Pierro, presidente dell’Italia dei Diritti, ha commentato il suo ultimo incatenamento davanti alla sede Rai di Saxa Rubra per sensibilizzare sul problema della rotazione intermunicipale dei vigili urbani e dei dipendenti degli uffici tecnici comunali romani. Da giorni il movimento è impegnato in una serie di azioni eclatanti che hanno interessato diversi luoghi della città ad elevata valenza istituzionale e informativa, tra cui Montecitorio, il Campidoglio,  l’edificio della Regione Lazio in via Cristoforo Colombo e le sedi romane dei quotidiani La Repubblica e Il Messaggero. L’ultimo in ordine di tempo è stato quello avvenuto davanti agli studi della televisione pubblica a Saxa Rubra, supportato da una considerevole fetta di opinione pubblica che ha apposto 30.000 firme a sostegno della battaglia e si è iscritta a un gruppo specifico sul social network Facebook, che conta alla data di oggi circa 4.000 membri. “Siamo sempre stati e saremo in prima linea nella tutela dei diritti dei cittadini – ha continuato De Pierro - e di fronte ad accadimenti che potrebbero lederli e conculcarli, non possiamo assolutamente rimanere indifferenti. Qualora la nostra proposta non venisse presa in considerazione in tempi utili, riterremo, come già precedentemente ribadito, politicamente responsabili i componenti della giunta Alemanno per qualsiasi vicenda relativa a tentate o consumate concussioni e corruzioni che danneggerebbero l'immagine dell'intero apparato degli uffici comunali. Se il primo cittadino  tiene davvero alla legalità, al di là dei meri proclami elettoralistici, non potrà esimersi dall'accettare di discutere le nostre proposte”.

Social Darwinism isn't so much a scientific idea, but an attempt to lend scientific credence to the idea that ""Might makes right"".  It was championed by one Herbert Spencer, who was not a scientist.  Scientists who have looked at his work say that it more closely resembles Lamarck's ideas than Darwin's.

This argument presupposes that women regularly married for financial reasons. It could be true, but I think it unlikely. The natural conclusion of this line of reasoning is that in an economically equal environment, everyone has sex as much as they like.

Actually, a WHO study found that it does not matter whether abortion is legal or not, the same number of women have them.  So, by making them illegal the number of abortions would not plummet, it would most likely drop off slightly, but the number of maternal complications and deaths would rise, resulting in more loss of life.  Which if you are truly concerned life and quality of life this should matter.  

And just for the record I think some drugs should be legal and taxed to fund education, and prostitutes should have to have a license and get regular health checks.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","First of all here is basic principles of what is slowing us down, and it has not much to do with speed of light.
Currently processors are working close to speed of light, and will probably work at speed of light once resistance in wires gets removed with optic fibers. But that is not the reason why technology is slow at the current moment, oh no. It has to do with the heat. This is why its difficult. Usually CPU is 1mm by 1mm chip and it uses craploads of electricity. In fact if you calculate it(but you did not ask for those), it produces 5 times as much power as the sun. So in the little box that you have right now, there is 5 times power of sun in there. Now the problem is to get rid of all that heat that is produced. When distance from one gate to another gate(which is what CPU is made out of, just simple gates) decreases, the heat increases. Smaller distance, means electricity has to travel less distance, means faster calculations, resulting in better performance. But the closer you bring components together, heat increases exponentially. But if you remove components, so far that they never overheat, you increase distance, thereby increasing time it takes electricity to go from one gate to another, which greatly decreases performance. So until we find a better way to cool things off (and currently US defense computers use liquid nitrogen to cool their CPUs and its still not enough) we will not be able to make things faster than they currently are. All we can do now is to add more cores.                                                              
So currently things get calculated at pretty much speed of light. I mean a simple operation for CPU to perform takes only 600 nanoseconds for load word commands (which are usually longest), and measly 150 nanoseconds to do a simple math calculation. It is insanely fast.","1272679573"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Cats, relatively speaking are fairly inexpensive and fairly low maintenance pets.  They get a lot of bang for their buck.  Purchasing costs aside (and there's many places you can find that will give away kittens for free - check your paper, there's always someone who's had a litter of kittens that just wants to find a good home for them) there's annual vet checkup &amp; possible vaccinations (I say possible because depending on your vet and your cat they may not vaccinate them every year.  There's a new school of thought that vaccinating every year for a strictly indoor cat is not necessary, and is only required every 2 years or so.  but there still is the annual check up which is approximately $50.  Call some local vets and inquire to get a more accurate quote for your area.

As long as your kitty is healthy this will be the only time you'll need to go to the vet.  However, it's extremely unlikely that you'll get this lucky.  There's bound to be something that will come up, so depending on what it is, your costs could increase quite quickly.  My cat was diagnosed with a heart murmur so there was a lot of costs associated with that when he was first being diagnosed.  He's fine now, and is just on medication for it which runs about $15 a month.  But it's good to expect that something may happen that requires medical intervention.  In this case, vets aren't cheap and the costs add up quite quickly.

Litter costs are pretty cheap, and once you have the supplies (box, litter &amp; scooper) a bag of litter will run you anywhere between $10-$20 and can last a few months.  Everyone is different, but I prefer the 'clumping' litter, it makes cleanup a lot easier and my cats seem to prefer it.  

What kind of food you feed your cat is probably the next biggest expense.  I have found through experience that raw food is the best for my cats.  My vet didn't expect my cat to live much more than 1 or 2 years, given his condition (he also has fluid around his lungs, which he was prescribed medication for as well, but later on it really started upsetting his stomach, he stopped eating and nearly died) but 7 years later he is still doing really well.  I credit that mainly to his diet.  Some people are strongly against it, and others find it icky but if you do some research on it, you can decide for yourself.  I feed Urban Carnivore (recently changed it's name to Carnivora - www.carnivora.ca  there are a couple of places in Montreal that carry it) and for 2 cats it's about $20 a month.  They share 1/2 a patty a day, and there are 8 patties per box, each box is about $10.  

Another thing you'll want to consider is toys and an outlet for your cats claws.  There's lots of fancy toys out there, and some of them are great, but I find my cats favorite toys are cardboard boxes.  Combine a few of those with a good scratching post and a few mice and balls and maybe a laser pointer and you're probably set.  

To summarize: in a regular month, a cat should cost about $20-$30, just keep some spare cash around for any incidentals.  It'll be well worth the money, I can't imagine life without my cats, although I'm sure my dog dreams about it daily.  ","1272679580"

First impressions though on the K-Pro sounds:

- I guesstimate that 30-40% of the Kaossilator sounds have made it to the K-Pro. As you probably know there are around 200 sound selections on the K-Pro.
- Most of the newer sounds are pretty cool, but I can only give my opinion of the drumbeats right now. 
  - Some of the new drumbeats are definitely usable, there's a generic Drum 'n Bass, there's even a Kraftwerk-like 'The Robots' drumbeat.  A couple of Latin drumbeats, and a few others I still have to investigate.
  - Some of the new drumbeats are definitely un-usable without major editing and fisting - sorry, did I say fisting? - I meant twisting. Forgive me for knowing this, there's also a Whitney {no-septum} Houston - 'I wanna dance with somebody' drumbeat.

I'll start with the most obvious difference: Bill Maher is a comedian. No one takes his words literally, and many don't take them seriously. If you watch his show, I think you might interpret that twitter joke as a caustic attempt at humor. As a semi-regular viewer, that's how I read it. I never saw him say that any of those people were ""personally responsible,"" as you claim, only a joke pointing out the consequences of their passion. You can argue that he's edging a fine line toward ""I told you so,"" but that is somewhat logically justifiable. The stance is generally more drilling means more problems for the environment. That was seemingly demonstrated by the spill.

On the other hand, Republicans possibly saying ""I told you so"" about this most recent attempted murder, in regard to the Arizona bill, is completely illogical. All the attack proves (assuming it's not an outlier, and I'm not saying that it is) is that there is a deadly problem with illegal immigrants running drugs, which I think you'll find most liberals agree with. It does not prove that the methods of the Arizona bill are the right approach. In other words, this crime is an indicator of the problem, not the solution.

Nobody is targeting the whole latino population. It's targeting the population that enters Arizona illegally.

Sweden has had by now 200 years of peace and peace works, apparently, and so does a constant influx of immigrants (20% of Swedish population of less than 10 million ATM), call me surprised. Finland actually rules because they have the most kick-ass education system in the world, but usually people tend to be blinded by the other 2. But they are also only around 5 million. Compare that with Poland. 38 million people. Levelled in 2 world wars. Millions of it's people massacred. Millions emigrated. Re-emerged on the map in 1918. Disappeared again in 1939 after the Ribbentrop-Molotov deal. Had to go through communism for 45 years, something very few Poles actually wanted (the only place where the Communists won the elections in Eastern Europe after 1945 was Czechoslovakia, the current second most pagan country in Europe, after the Estonians who are the first). Not surprisingly, it ended in the '90s up as one of the poorest countries in Europe.

You missed the point. The answer is...there is no likely. It is a yes or no question. If there was some way to gauge the likelihood, like between 1 and 100 and you came up with the number 87.3, what would that number represent? It is still a yes or no question. and if you were 87.3% sure that Jesus is in your frying pan, you may still be wrong. If you had ALL the information required to know whether he was in your frying pan or not, then you should have a yes or no answer. The fact is you don't even know how much of the available information you actually have. You may be basing your answer on only 0.0000000000001% of the total relevant information.

Airplane.  I came down with something that would have cost over $20,000.  Had the surgery overseas.  Paid $3,000 cash.

Dunno if she needs the whole thing out (sounds like not) but doing some research an example gallbladder surgery will typically be in the tens of thousands in the US.  [Here is a biased price comparison but apparently gallstones are a big source of medical tourism.](http://www.allmedicaltourism.com/usa/surgery/gall-bladder-removal/)

Overseas it will cost you $5k or possibly much less.  I would go to a *recommended* **private** hospital in Mexico if it was my choice.  Other options are Costa Rica, India, Thailand or Singapore (where I am.)

Recently I did the same again (I thought I had something more serious then it turned out I did.)  Now I live in this country without a broken medical system.

If it isn't going to kill you in the next week or so - fly overseas.  Take a vacation and get it fixed.

The problem with being a student is you obviously have enough money to not qualify for charity programs and assistance because you can afford school.  But, forced with the choice of dropping out of school to get medical care... well, I have been there myself.

[Edited : Added some more data as an example.]
[Edited : Added some price data pertaining to gallstones.]

**[Edit : Singapore posts all prices for all medical procedures online as we are public option.  The surgery will set you back about $1200 if you come here to Singapore.  (1USD == 1.5SGD)  Our hospitals are better then the US anyways.  That price is if you don't mind sharing a room for your recuperation at the national hospital.

And while it's far from perfect there, most of the ethnic groups manage to get along with each other reasonably well. Meanwhile, India has perhaps a dozen, all of which are concentrated in three separate families that provide large percentages of the population with easily as much shared cultural history as China has, and they still can't get along. It's not the ethnicities that make India the way it is, it's the completely screwed-up cultural systems that institutionalize prejudice and encourage people to think in terms of how their neighbors will contaminate them.

Ask people to proof read and make sure that they will be critical and not ""oh that's pretty good"" try to have them say specifics. 
I don't have a problem with your writing but there is a picture at the bottom of the page that shows up as a broken picture link to me and something about your website layout bothers me. I don't like to see advertisements and they might be in awkward spots that confuse people into thinking they are actual content. I know you might want people to click them but it feels cluttered. an example is that youtube video on the right hand side, I thought maybe it was actual content but really it was an ad for some EA game. The ads by google bar(s) running across the top of the page are a little bit cluttered feeling too. The 90x300 pixel ad almost seems like it is some sort of logo or name of the website. Personally I like ads more towards the bottom or just in a small section of the page so it doesn't get confused with content and cause a headache while I am trying to browse. I know you probably want to make money etc but it will make your website more pleasant (at least to me) Also it feels like the page is a bit long. Maybe it would be better if you only had ~7? posts on the page and had a clear button to press to see more posts?
Your writing seems fine to me and your content is interesting too its just the format of the page that doesn't set right with me.

Sorry about the wall of text.

I do know, however, that soldiers have one of the highest rates of suicide of any occupation, along with police officers.  In fact, police officers are something like **eighteen** times more likely to commit suicide than to be killed on the job.

Why is that?  Of course, job stress is an easy answer, but the real answer is more subtle and slightly counter-intuitive: they have access to guns.  The mere fact of owning a weapon increases your chances of committing suicide enormously.  It's not just that people have a bad episode and end it there - it's that for those prone to depression, a gun is a constant, often daily reminder that there is a nearby exit.  Normally we think of guns as they are portrayed in movies and on TV - used to shoot the bad guys.  In reality, you're much more likely to use it on yourself.

They also will pay attention to what people hate about the same group, and do everything they can to cater to that stated set of issues.

The Android market it is pretty much open, so Microsoft is competing with them.  They also realize in order to entice Apple's customer base, they need to come up with a UI that is simple and easy to use, and capable of everything Apple's UI can't do.

Competition is great for Microsoft.  It makes them get their heads out, and actually ""innovate"", vs. sitting around and tossing out new versions with one or two new features.","1272679808"

"lgbt","t5_2qhh7","Hey there, I'm about 7-8 months out of the closest, and probably about 6 months since my first sexual encounter with a guy. I'm bi as well and I don't find anal sex all that pleasant.

I've been with one or two fairly dominant guys and they wanted to do anal so I tried. It was pretty uncomfortable and in the case of the one who had an above average love poker, kinda painful :/

I talked about it with them after and they were both understanding, saying they wouldn't do it if it wasn't pleasant for me &lt;3. I don't know about the norm or what to generally expect from guys, but that was my experience. I'm not completely against it though, I'd be willing to do it for someone special.

Actually, I've experimented (for prep and practice) with some solo anal stimulation and found out..er....well lets just say I really like it. I haven't been in relationship since I made that discovery but I've set aside, as an idea for a date, to visit a love shop and experiment with some vibrating things maybe :P

**Added**: Rereading your post, I realized I missed the mark a little. You mentioned that you don't like the idea of anal. I can understand that as I didn't either. It took awhile for me to come around, but I found that reading up on it helped me understand more about it. Your prostate is sometimes a whole other world of pleasure. Even if you aren't interested in getting poked there yourself, it might be a good thing to know about in case your partner does enjoy anything anal related.","1272679857"

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt;you state that brain activity determines if an organism is human or not.

No,  you're reading comprehension is about on par with a 5 year old.  Pasting your tainted watered down understanding of what I tell you back on me is does not make them my assertions.  I said brain *development* determines sentience.

&gt;the fact that we know he is going to recover in the future would be as irrelevant as the fact that we know the fetus will, unless death by natural causes, also be fully conscious in the future.

**Analogy:**

&gt;A Pentium processor does not cease being a Pentium processor when the power has been turned off.   It does not cease being a processor when it is slightly damaged and runs 100 MHz slower. It only ceases being a processor when it loses its ability to process.  

A significantly damaged brain is no longer sentient in much the same way.   A misdiagnosed patients with insignificant damage is sentient.  

&gt; if the fetus can be killed now because scientists says its appears they lack humanity, we could just as easily pull the plug on the man without fear of murdering someone

Gross oversimplification.  The physical condition must be considered, not just activity.  Currently impossible, but a cryogenically frozen head would be considered sentient, just not active at the moment, just like you're misdiagnosed brain damaged patient.

&gt;The point here is that they have no bright line rule for when it becomes human.

They do, can you read motherfucker.  Again, distorting, or in this case completely reversing what I tell you and regurgitating it back does not mean I some how seed a point.  

&gt;by their own admission, it is a vague notion; 

Now you're just flat out lying when it comes to what I said on abortion, which I said doesn't translate with brain damage.  I didn't say it and the information I posted didn't say it.  Your half-witted interpretation of one word does not change that.

&gt;they can monitor physical development of the brain, and can detect activity in that brain to an extent, but can make no claims as to when humanity starts

They can, and in fact have, with no ambiguity done just that.  Cry all you like, the science is against you.  It clearly states there is sentience only after the 3rd trimester, ages after anyone is legally allowed to abort.  That thin line you are claiming is, what, 2/3rds of the pregnancy.

&gt;on a side note, i would refrain from posting when on the rag,

Last time I checked my cock doesn't bleed for 5 days but never die, but way to exemplify what a brain dead sexist pig you are.  Bet that shit goes over real well with the pregnant brain dead 17 year olds you meet in church.

The buoyancy of the oil will displace the water until the tube is full of oil, then simply pump it out of the tube at the rate of leakage. You get to bottle the oil and it stops leaking into the ocean.

Roma - “Non avendo ancora ricevuto alcun riscontro dagli organi competenti, la nostra protesta prosegue con maggior determinazione, perché la problematica incide negativamente sull’espletamento delle funzioni del pubblico impiego”.

Con questa frase Antonello De Pierro, presidente dell’Italia dei Diritti, ha commentato il suo ultimo incatenamento davanti alla sede Rai di Saxa Rubra per sensibilizzare sul problema della rotazione intermunicipale dei vigili urbani e dei dipendenti degli uffici tecnici comunali romani. Da giorni il movimento è impegnato in una serie di azioni eclatanti che hanno interessato diversi luoghi della città ad elevata valenza istituzionale e informativa, tra cui Montecitorio, il Campidoglio,  l’edificio della Regione Lazio in via Cristoforo Colombo e le sedi romane dei quotidiani La Repubblica e Il Messaggero. L’ultimo in ordine di tempo è stato quello avvenuto davanti agli studi della televisione pubblica a Saxa Rubra, supportato da una considerevole fetta di opinione pubblica che ha apposto 30.000 firme a sostegno della battaglia e si è iscritta a un gruppo specifico sul social network Facebook, che conta alla data di oggi circa 4.000 membri. “Siamo sempre stati e saremo in prima linea nella tutela dei diritti dei cittadini – ha continuato De Pierro - e di fronte ad accadimenti che potrebbero lederli e conculcarli, non possiamo assolutamente rimanere indifferenti. Qualora la nostra proposta non venisse presa in considerazione in tempi utili, riterremo, come già precedentemente ribadito, politicamente responsabili i componenti della giunta Alemanno per qualsiasi vicenda relativa a tentate o consumate concussioni e corruzioni che danneggerebbero l'immagine dell'intero apparato degli uffici comunali. Se il primo cittadino  tiene davvero alla legalità, al di là dei meri proclami elettoralistici, non potrà esimersi dall'accettare di discutere le nostre proposte”.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","There are, to me, two kinds of hipsters:

The first are the butt of countless jokes. They're the ones who wear their kefiyehs and go vegan and study gender and conflict studies, *but without any reason other than that they think it's cool*. They binge drink and chain smoke and scoff at nearly every person not involved in their subculture and unfamiliar with what Pitchfork magazine decided is the next big name (*Grizzly Bear! No, Vampire Weekend! No, too mainstream! Now Animal Collective!*). It's a rigid, shallow, vain, and narcissistic culture which glories nothing but the ever-shifting, ever-unattainable idea of ""cool,"" although to even call it ""cool"" is totally lame.

On the other hand, though, there are the people who are often lumped into the group ""hipster"" but lacking in its characteristic narcissism. They're primarily white, middle class, suburban but they moved to a more urban area. They listen to indie music and wear hipsteresque clothing, are registered Democrats, and study the humanities or the environment. They are often vilified because of their close association with the aforementioned group of people, but I have no hard feelings toward the plaid-wearing, Jonathan Safran Foer-reading, tea-drinking sort of white people.

In fact, I fit pretty neatly into the latter category, as would, I imagine, quite a bit of Reddit. I see it as the distinction between [latfh.com](http://www.latfh.com/) [the former] and [stuffwhitepeoplelike.com](http://stuffwhitepeoplelike.com/) [the more genial latter].

"Music","t5_2qh1u","Radio listeners of Majic 102.3 have scheduled a protest demonstration for next Sunday May 2, 2010 at 3 pm outside Radio One headquarters, 5900 Princess Garden Parkaway, Lanham Md,
For cancelling a popular long running Sunday afternoon radio show ""Majic Memories"" geared toward African American baby boomers.  We are asking listeners to come out and turn in their 30 and over club cards.
This music from the 60's and 70's have brought us through very difficult times in America, such as the civil rights movement and the Viet-Nam era.  To take this away from us is sending a message that Radio One discounts it's older listener base which supported Radio One from it's beginning in the DC area, and that the music has no value in the African American community.  This decision was made by Jay Stevens, VP of programming content.  It appears that Mr. Stevens (who is not of Afrcan American descent) has no clue or idea how his decision has affected the African American community in the DC metropolitan area.
 
It seems that Mr. Stevens' stands for the younger folk whose music he may be more familiar with.
He has totally discounted listeners who have put this station where it is!
There are many, many listeners who, like me, ONLY listen to the station for Ron V's stylish ""Majic Memories"" program;
You know, the one that plays music that has become identified with the Baby Boomer generation.
That's the generation that listened to WOL, WOOK, WUST, WWDC, WPGC and other music stations that helped us grow up and prosper. Now, WMMJ has become the last commercial station to drop Motown classics and TRUE R&amp;B/Soul music as the DC City once known as Chocolate City becomes increasingly Vanilla and Mocha.
Black history is in the music of the past, not the present or future for so many, many listeners.
How proud can WMMJ be of  itself  when it eliminates playing songs that mean so much to its most faithful/vintage-eared listeners?
 
A sad state of affairs has become 102.3's ""Hits and Oldies"" moniker.
Where are the TRUE Oldies?

I wrote a lot, I read piles of books, I did a ton of hiking, I played my guitar, I went into town and mixed it up at the bars or went to shows.  Basically I made sure that I always had *something* that i could be focusing on.

I mostly hung out in libraries and coffee shops.  Pretty early in my trip, I spent most of a Saturday afternoon mapping out almost every library from New Mexico to Wyoming, so basically anywhere I went I would know how to get to the closest library.

I had my laptop and an extra monitor for work (total luxury, I know..), all my clothes, some boots, some running shoes, some sandals, all my camping gear (tent, sleeping back, stove, pot, utensils, etc.), a guitar, a week's worth of food, 10-20 gallons of water, my cell phone, two pocket knives and a multitool, typical car stuff (jumper cables, wrenches, etc.), hygiene stuff (rubbing alcohol, soap, extra glasses, baby powder, deodorant, toothbrush and toothpaste) and a thorough first aid kit.  I was fortunate in that I didn't have to forgo much because I had so much space in the truck.  ","1272680296"

I didn't make sweeping generalizations. I noted that I have seen very few liberals noting their opposition to Barack Obama or his policies, nothing about how ""liberals kiss Obama's ass"", as you suggested. In fact, I tried to stray away from generalizations. 

&gt;I've seen quite a few articles about Obama's extension of the Patriot Act, continuation of the wars, etc, hit the front page. They've been making it there since he was campaigning. At least on Reddit, people seem very critical of Obama. His successes also hit the front page, and when you read the comments on either story, you see a mix of opinions.

&gt;I'm sure there's probably some lock-step folk who support everything Obama does, but that's hardly descriptive of an entire group of people. I can also say with certainty that I've yet to find anyone personally who acts like that. The people I've spoken to who voted for him praise his work to pass Health care reform, and curse him for his extension of the Patriot Act in the same breath.

I definitely would not describe Reddit as critical of Barack Obama. Sure, as I pointed out I have seen some criticism of Barack Obama, but for the most part, critical articles and comments of Barack Obama and his policies are down voted, what I would describe inappropriately.

I always drive the speed limit. My insurance rates are high enough as they are, so unless you want to cover the cost of my speeding ticket and another insurance rate hike, then I'm not going to speed up for you.

I don't drive in the left lane if there is a reasonable alternative option. I general, I get over to pass someone if they are going less than the speed limit, then get over once I'm at a safe distance ahead of them.

That said, it's not always reasonable to stay out of the left lane. On my drive into work for example, the interstate is 3 lanes, however at one point it splits so that each lane goes in a different direction. I need to be in the left lane to get onto my exit, but if I don't get over several miles ahead of when I actually need to get off the interstate then I'll invariably be forced off onto another exit because nobody will fucking let me over.

So, on the way to work I get in the left lane and I drive the speed limit, and it sometimes pisses people off, but fuck 'em, I may be being an asshole, but it's out of necessity.","1272680367"

"movies","t5_2qh3s","Note to filmmakers:  In the early 1960s, Hollywood movies were given extra potency by using and showing references to real geography and foreign nations.  Then very suddenly it stopped, for bizarre and opaque reasons.  I suspect that the bad assumption was that such references would ""turn people off"", because they had never heard of such places.

In truth, such information actually lights up the brain, and makes people pay more attention.

Though Kubrick used a mix of real and imaginary place names, ""Zhokhov Island"" being real, but the primary target called ""Laputa"" was a double entendre, referring to both an imaginary floating island in Gulliver's Travels, and to the Spanish language insult ""La puta"", ""the whore.""

Yet the effect of the movie was to portray that the B-52 was flying over the vastness of the Soviet Union.  Very few movies, even today, try to replicate such exotic realism.  Even when filmed on location, they look like they were filmed on a studio back lot.

This is that wonderful combination of direction and cinematography that makes a quality movie.  Film patrons don't want familiarity in imagery, they want more than just the tiny slice of the world that is the ""American look.""

A great example is the original Star Wars.  They went all the way to Tunisia for a ""look"", and yet what they got was so ordinary, later versions filmed in the desert near Yuma, AZ, just a few hundred miles away from Hollywood.  Looked the same.

It's a shame you have to look at a foreign film to see something, anything different than the ""American look"".","1272680431"

When I was in elementary school we were careful with peanut products; ate them outside and washed our hands, but these days you get in big shit for sending anything with peanut products along with your kids. I baked peanut-butter oatmeal cookies and without even thinking sent them to school when I packed my little brother his lunch while I was visiting my parents recently. He flipped out on me and said that he could have gotten suspended for bringing them to school. 

I think it's great that schools try really hard to make sure the kids are safe, but I've always wondered about whether or not it has kind of a detrimental effect. Once those kids get to high school or the ""real world"" will they know how to take care of themselves properly once they're outside the bubble?

My guineas live with my chickens and they get along fairly well.  Most sources say that they don't live well together, but mine were raised with a batch of chicks, so they seem to be doing OK together.  The guinea hens even tend to lay in the chicken next boxes while free-ranging.  However, the male guineas tend to be total dicks to the roosters for some reason.  Guineas are a lot quicker than chickens and like to chase the roosters around and pull out their tail feathers.   They are never aggressive toward the hens though, so there's a good chance that they would leave pigeons alone.

Note that you can't have guineas if you have neighbours close-by.   Both males and females are LOUD.","1272680508"

I think the idea that there is a god is as preposterous as the idea that there is a Santa Claus. Anybody who consider Biblical scripture to be credible scientific evidence for the existence of a god is a dullard. However, it doesn't mean we skip into mental ward talk of ""knowing a thing doesn't exist"". It's just a ludicrous concept. I *strongly* disbelieve that the Yahweh is a real entity, it seems much more likely to have been concocted by human imagination. It still makes no sense to say I *know* Yahweh does not exist, the concept itself is just impossible. You literally can't *know* a thing does not exist. It seems like you're confusing ""strongly disbelieving"" (a possible concept) with ""knowledge of a thing's nonexistence"" (an impossible concept). We're probably on the same page for the most part, but it just seems like the ""gnostic"" axis is superfluous, since it seems to really just mean strongly believe (""know""), or strongly disbelieve (""know"").","1272680524"

My generation (I am 21) views success as something tangible, such as good grades or a large bank account.

As far as grades are concerned, you don't need to learn, you need to memorize and regurgitate.  I have had teachers try to fail me for not doing homework, even though I had a 96% average.  I have had an English teacher take marks off of homework for doing extra research.  I got stuck in a class that teaches typing and was told ""Don't type so fast, you discourage other students.""

The reason why we don't get it is is because you (not you, but teachers in general) taught us that way.  The highly motivated who want to go to a good school and have the kind of life they want thus learn that it doesn't matter what we learn, or how we do it, as long as we get an A on a piece of paper.  We are never taught the importance of a quality education because we are never shown a quality education, we are only shown that education is a means to an end.","1272680669"

I have a great deal of difficulty comprehending parents that would do this sort of thing to their children. You have to be true to yourself, and you'd hope a parent would be able to understand that about their children better than anyone else.

If your parents are very lucky, they will figure out that what they've done is terrible and eventually apologize, but don't hold your breath waiting for it.

Toleration of behavior should only go so far as to allow people to make autonomous decisions that they want to make. A lot of religious people follow along with their religion not because they were raised as rational people who later chose to adhere to a religion but because they were raised in a community that basically forced the religion upon them and have essentially brainwashed them into following along. So when someone asks how is forcing a woman not to wear it any different from forcing her to wear it- there is a big difference. A vast majority of those choosing to wear one aren't really making a free choice, their upbringing and community have driven them towards one choice, not their own free will.

I'd like a law that says no one is to have anything to do with religion until they're 18; parents shouldn't be allowed to drag their kids into their weird beliefs when the children don't have a mind developed enough to make sense of what's going on. Then by the time they do they've had religion forced upon them in their youth and now they're subconsciously pushed towards one choice over another.","1272680688"

That's a pretty common reaction but the mature and reasonable response would be to look around you to see if these ideas are fringe or central, and react accordingly.

To be honest, I feel this way when I'm in twoxchromasomes /r/ because any time I have a dissenting opinion, no matter how mature and reasoned my response, it is almost always met with a deluge of downvotes. But you should take comfort in the fact that a great number of posts in here are trashing this article instead of celebrating it.

&gt;And I wonder, is that the point where all the feminist haters are? Were they pushed there, by feeling much the same way I do right now?

Maybe. There is often a palpable need for retribution among many Western women nowadays and a lot of men with their tails between their legs, but one thing you'll notice about getting a hate-on: it's never enough. Nothing will ever be fair enough or balanced enough and you might eventually wind up blogging about how some fucking guy is a pervert because he asked to buy you a cup of coffee or told you you were pretty.

What this means is:
 A. The government can make profit off of it (which would probably help with the debt at least a little bit) as opposed to organized crime.
B. Said 'undesirable' substances can be kept out of the hands of minors much in the way cigarettes and alcohol are today (I remember back in highschool it was easier to get pot than it was go get cigarettes).
C. Nonviolent offenders won't end up in prison, and your tax dollars won't go to keeping them in jail, once again freeing up a lot of money for the federal government.

However, despite these benefits, do I see legalization of any now illegal substances ever happening?

No, too many people believe that just because they find a substance undesirable it is ""bad"" and everyone must be prohibited from using it. Top many people believe that legalization will corrupt America's youth and lead this country straight to hell. Too many people don't believe in things as important as personal freedom.","1272680762"

That depends on your definition of ""operations"". Almost all compilers will get

    int a = 1 + 2;

and optimize it to:

    int a = 3;

This makes code much more readable, because you can perform arithmatic operations on named constants without runtime penalty. However, it does perform a different sequence of ""operations"". It also changes the timing of the program.

The definition of program semantics that almost all programmers expect today is that two sequences of side-effect-free operations that yield the same result are equal. In other words, `1 + 2` is the same as `3`. Burning CPU cycles is not considered a side-effect.

Under that definition, compiling out an empty loop is perfectly valid. If we *didn't* follow that definition, *all* compiler optimizations would be eliminated, yielding much worse performance for all software in use.","1272680784"

Also get lots of peer reviews before you even submit... if friend/colleague rejects your paper and you hold the paper, he/she has saved you a few months of time. ","1272680846"

I let it drop when I got to college (couldn't fit it into my schedule and I didn't have anybody to talk French with), and now sort of regret it.  But it's definitely the case that fluency in another language can affect how you think (I mostly think in words), and it would be awful if a way of thinking were erased from the world.

When I listened to Absolution and had to sit through ""/lips are turning blue/a kiss that can't renew/I only dream of you/my beautiful""  I almost had to shut off the cd.  I really don't care about their live performances because currently they are outrageously priced (My friend had to take his girlfriend to see them.  He's out something like $250 a ticket, plus parking, plus gas to travel, plus Ticketmaster fees, food, etc) and stadium arena rock performances bore me especially when I don't like any of the songs to begin with.  

Personally I think they happen to be hitting it big because frankly popular hardrock right now is completely shit.  As much as I loathe them because I feel they have so much wasted potential, they are one of the best popular rock bands currently touring and hopefully will cause fans to explore more music.","1272680960"

"WTF","t5_2qh61","Everyone at Fox News needs to watch Mr Rogers testifying about PBS in Congress:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXEuEUQIP3Q

I'm very much concerned, as I know you are, about what's being delivered to our children in this country. And I've worked in the field of child development for six years now, trying to understand the inner needs of children. We deal with such things as -- as the inner drama of childhood. We don't have to bop somebody over the head to...make drama on the screen. We deal with such things as getting a haircut, or the feelings about brothers and sisters, and the kind of anger that arises in simple family situations. And we speak to it constructively.

Mr. Rogers: We made a hundred programs for EEN, the Eastern Educational Network, and then when the money ran out, people in Boston and Pittsburgh and Chicago all came to the fore and said we've got to have more of this neighborhood expression of care. And this is what -- This is what I give. I give an expression of care every day to each child, to help him realize that he is unique. I end the program by saying, ""You've made this day a special day, by just your being you. There's no person in the whole world like you, and I like you, just the way you are."" And I feel that if we in public television can only make it clear that feelings are mentionable and manageable, we will have done a great service for mental health. I think that it's much more dramatic that two men could be working out their feelings of anger -- much more dramatic than showing something of gunfire. I'm constantly concerned about what our children are seeing, and for 15 years I have tried in this country and Canada, to present what I feel is a meaningful expression of care.

Senator Pastore: Do you narrate it?

Mr. Rogers: I'm the host, yes. And I do all the puppets and I write all the music, and I write all the scripts --

Senator Pastore: Well, I'm supposed to be a pretty tough guy, and this is the first time I've had goose bumps for the last two days.

Mr. Rogers: Well, I'm grateful, not only for your goose bumps, but for your interest in -- in our kind of communication. Could I tell you the words of one of the songs, which I feel is very important?

Senator Pastore: Yes.

Mr. Rogers: This has to do with that good feeling of control which I feel that children need to know is there. And it starts out, ""What do you do with the mad that you feel?"" And that first line came straight from a child. I work with children doing puppets in -- in very personal communication with small groups:

What do you do with the mad that you feel? When you feel so mad you could bite. When the whole wide world seems oh so wrong, and nothing you do seems very right. What do you do? Do you punch a bag? Do you pound some clay or some dough? Do you round up friends for a game of tag or see how fast you go? It's great to be able to stop when you've planned the thing that's wrong. And be able to do something else instead -- and think this song --

'I can stop when I want to. Can stop when I wish. Can stop, stop, stop anytime....And what a good feeling to feel like this! And know that the feeling is really mine. Know that there's something deep inside that helps us become what we can. For a girl can be someday a lady, and a boy can be someday a man.'

Senator Pastore: I think it's wonderful. I think it's wonderful. Looks like you just earned the 20 million dollars.","1272681013"

"psychology","t5_2qhcz","difficult parents really are not that bad.  they are looking out for their child's best interest.  basically try to give them your hear and try your best to solve their problem.  of course always being available on email helps to ease their concern as you can sometimes nip their anxiety more quickly than my peers who don't answer email during certain times.

i really don't have many common concerns until college time when explaining the schools they want to apply to really are not a good choice as they will not get in.  then again i am of the mold there really are no difference between undergrad degrees and students should try to save money on the selective pricey grad programs where you can grow as a student.  the biggest step of concern is just working with kids to get to know you are on their side.  once the students start seeing you often, they will work with you more than you can imagine.  being always available and always having your door open definitely helps.  i only close my door when something does not need to be heard.

i think i am having less contact with students because i am having parent/student conference regarding post-secondary planning.  i am meeting with less students but for longer periods of time.  i feel like i am repeating myself and i am tired from coaching afterwards, but maybe i am having more contact as i enjoy the actual dialogue.  it really is what you make of it, but i feel under utilized in the school setting.  when a real case comes up regarding mental health, your hands are tied regarding what you can and cant ask.

when i start private it will be both school and personal.  i enjoy the stories and personal growth from working with adolescents.  i want to work in a practice so i can ask for supervision and insight from my peers as if i was alone it would be difficult to serve clients best as a different perspective is always better than one.

i am planning on going for a phd after i get my license.  i only want to do one thing at a time as working full time, coaching in the spring adds 15-18 hours additional work/week makes very little time for extra studying.  i am thinking counseling supervision as a possible doctoral program as i do not think i would get into a research based program, nor do i think i would like that as i enjoy actual human interaction more so than studying it.","1272681079"

"food","t5_2qh55","You might me able to cook meat without it getting rubbery if you put it in a class container or similar with a lid and perhaps some oil,water, stock or sauce. Microwaves do their best by basically steaming food, like veggies, but meat doesn't have as much moisture and tends to get rubbery. 

However considering you can meat tender meat in a pressure cooker I assume you can get meat tender meat in a microwave using steam, never tried it, but might be interesting experiment. I always add water in a bowl when cooking things like potatoes because they tend to dry out more quickly then other veggies.

You might find an electric burner at a local goodwill or thrift shop, they should get red hot and allow you to use your normal pots and pans. Walmart also sells them for 12-20 bucks. But I'd just learn how to cook meat in the microwave and save the money for gas personally. Goodwill almost always has slow cookers for a few dollars or even toaster/table top convection ovens for 20 bucks or so.

If the electric skillet can't cook meat it sounds pretty useless. Just like in a pan cutting the meat into strips or chunks will help it cook easier, as will adding oil to the meat and microwaving in a closed container.

In addition to everything else, if you haven't heard him read, *do yourself a favour*:  get a recording (torrent if you must -- what you gain in karma will more than outweigh what you lose).  His voice lulls you and scares you out of your wits at the same time.  He makes you laugh and fear for your soul all at once.  

And no matter how old he got, no matter how decrepit he appeared, he was *always* ahead of the curve by, oh, a generation, and everyone around him knew it:  http://www.ambient.ca/jrcgrafx/jrcwsb.jpg 

Here he is with more young poets, this time around Seattle, who clearly recognize that he is younger than they are:  http://www.flickr.com/photos/matthetube/3643116553/

The wiki page:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_S._Burroughs  You can find all the boring, already-known stuff here, like how he inspired and squired Jack Kerouac and Neal Cassidy and Allen Ginsberg.  We all know that stuff already, right?

His books may be here if the torrent is genuine:  http://btjunkie.org/torrent/William-S-Burroughs-e-book-collection/3815b7113b71852f11c357b10cdab00069882eae5f87.  I don't know if it's genuine.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","If you want to party, you need to go to a club known as 'ageHa'.  It is consistently rated one of the best clubs in the world, and frequently brings it top-name DJs like Tiesto, Deadmau5, Ferry Corsten...  It's mostly a Japanese crowd, with the occasional foreigner - but it is an EXPERIENCE.  It's literally a super-club.

The party starts at 11 PM and goes until 6 AM - this club is located on the end of the Yurakucho line (gold subway line), at Shin-Kiba station.  Note that there is NOTHING else around in this area except for a 7-11, and the last train out is at 12:15 or so, so when you go, you are pretty much stuck there.  Note that the cover varies between 3000 and 4000 yen, and drinks from 700 to 1200 - but it is worth it if you can afford it.   For more info, just google it!

I went there this past summer every weekend for over two months, and had an incredible time.  One of my favorite places to party - EVER.  It's, again, off the beaten path, and mostly Japanese - so much so that every time we went, we had at least half a dozen Japanese people offering us their drinks when they realized we were white (I'm a guy, so they weren't trying to date-rape me, no worries).  It's really, really fun, and I would highly recommend it.  There are four DJs playing simultaneously, the main hall is usually Techno/House, and the other 3 DJs vary night to night.  There is an outdoor dance floor around a pool, and you can literally dance poolside all night and watch the sun rise on Tokyo Bay.  It is truly exquisite.

Other highlights of ageHa include rollerskating girls dressed as bunnies, a secret sex shop in a stall in the women's bathroom, a food court, an advanced laser lighting system, a real young and chill crowd, a field you can relax on by the bay, and a pole gymnast show performed twice nightly.  Different nights have different events - one night they had a full-blown Cirque du Soleil act in the main hall, with a dozen acrobats performing above the dancing crowd.  Another night they had a modern dance performance on a platform in the center of the arena - it's truly something else.  Make sure to go on a Saturday!

Oh, and one other tip: STAY OUT OF ROPPONGI AT NIGHT.  Truly sketchy, and mostly foreign - you will not get the ""Tokyo"" experience there.

If you are too afraid to go so far off the beaten path to ageHa, you might also consider Club Womb in Shibuya - it's nestled pretty far back in the Love Hotel district of Shibuya, but it is a great time when you find it.","1272681193"

"chess","t5_2qhr7","What rating are you?  A lot of people say that beginners should play open games (1.e4 e5) because: they are heavily dependant on tactics, which is probably what you are best at, they give you a chance to practice tactics, and they are the most straightforward (you will usually be able to figure out why you won or lost).

1. d4 games may be more subtle, and a relative beginner may lack the finesse to be able to navigate the closed positions created.

Hypermodern systems should probably be avoided until you deeply learn strategy.  You are making too many sacrifices in terms of space and tempo and likely will not be able to prove any structural compensation gained.  

If you play e4, you need to have a strategy prepared for 1. e4 e5, 1. e4 c5, 1. e4 c6, 1. e4 e6.  You will see 1. e4 d5 and 1. e4 d6 but the play against these is very straightforward.

1. e4 e5 is where you have a lot of choices, ostensibly the best being the Ruy Lopez, but contains dangerous theoretical territory and many tight positions.   Other choices are the scotch game, very easy to play and straight forward and has a lot of traps that opponents won't know about.  There is also the Guico Piano, including the mainline with d4 and the Evans Gambit (I would avoid the Pianissimo for now). 

1. e4 c5 is the nightmare of many club players, but in reality the white player can just play calmly, it is the black player who must be sharp.  That being said, there are many anti-sicilians you can learn, my favorite being the delayed grand prix attack.

1. e4 c6 and 1. e4 e6 are both very straightforward to play against.  If you do not want to learn the mainlines, you can play exchange variations of both for a fairly simple game.


As black you need to have a response to 1. e4, 1. d4, 1. Nf6.  Against 1. c5 you can just respond symmetrically.  With 1. e4, you can play any of the above systems, I recommend against the sicilian for beginners though.  1. e4 e5 is really a great choice, just be prepared for spanish torture if you play Nc6.  The Caro Kann is good for beginners who want to go semi-open.

Against 1. d4 and hypermoderns, I find a London System style setup to be great for beginners.


The main thing that you need to keep in mind is that learning openings is not just about memorizing lines.  The most important thing that you learn when studying an opening is the understanding of the pawn structures that arise in that opening, and how to find advantages in them.","1272681201"

For his Intro to CS class, he makes other programming games with robots people control on a turn-by-turn basis with cards that they got from answering questions right.

Would that commentator still have a place on a mainstream network?

I hear what you're saying, and I agree, but I think the word can be defined in either way, and there will be some people who qualify according to either definition, and it wouldn't be the same people.

In regards to the whole argument.  I think it is correct to say that a random non-contradicting claim just having to do on whether or not something exists can be known, but it is true that you can't know that it doesn't.  Square circles is self-contradicting, meanwhile the proposed dragon, or the orbiting teapot we can't say we ""know"" they don't exist.  But if we found them yes we can know that they do exist.

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","It's been a while since I've seen the actual stats and estimates but previous years tend to be more accurate than estimates for current years, since they have a better chance to look at all the data:

In 2004 the IRS issued about 1 to1.5 million ITINs. That same year the IRS received 7.9 million tax returns with names that didn't match the SSNs. Most analysts estimate that there were between 10-16 millon illegal aliens in the US that year, so a rough approximation is about 73% give or take 5 points.

In 2007 the  Congressional Budget Office estimates that guest workers &amp; newly legalized immigrants  would generate  about $48 billion dollars in additional tax and Social Security revenues, while only using about $23 billion worth of tax credits and social services over 10years.

In 2007 White House Council of Economic Advisers estimated that immigrants and their descendants (the last part is important) would contribute $80,000 more in taxes than they would receive in public services.

O yeah Illegal aliens put money into social security, but they don't retire or collect on it: http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/05/business/05immigration.html?_r=1

The taxes paid by illegal immigrants will close 15 percent of the Social Security’s projected long-term deficit.

That's just tax benefits. I didn't even go over other benefits: 

Have you heard of Japan and Italy's problems of an aging population? Well just like us their main population doesn't produce as much children anymore like back in the old days, while the older folks are living a lot longer now. Unlike us their deportation and border immigration agencies work really well so both of those countries are quickly becoming large retirement homes, since they dont' have enough immigration (legal is just too small) to fill in the void. Japan's solution to make up for it is with robots. I guess they haven't watched any of the Terminator movies yet.

All I know is that our industries need cheap labor, and I (and probably most Americans) have no interest in our kids growing up to pick fruit. Moreover our military needs more soldiers, both present and future. If border patrol and ICE were actually successful it would be disastrous. If we lose cheap factory labor, what do you propose as the alternative? Losing and moving even more factories to China, or... Mexico (we won WWII mainly from our industrial output you know - for every Panzer we made like 20 Shermans)? State enforced protectionism and even more welfare handouts to business? What about our exports? As for cheap food production labor, say goodbye to food just costing about 5-10% of a family's income. It'll probably rise up to at least 33%, like it was in the past. What's your solution for that?

If this was anything new, what I'd have to say is just conjecture, but every major ethnic group that has ever immigrated to the US over time eventually assimilates to American culture and language, and contributes to both US industry and the US military; and like the way the Mexicans are being treated now, back then people hated on the Irish, Germans, Italians, Chinese, Japanese, and even Jewish immigrants. Probably the only known exception to this is the city of Miami (which may turn into the US version of Quebec one day).","1272681294"

Back to topic though, if you haven't already, you may want to see a counselor and see if you have a social phobia or outright avoidant personality disorder. Knowing that there is a way to help does wonders (coming from a person who has dealt with/is still dealing with low self esteem). Additionally, there might be treatment options available.

Also, from how it sounds, you have problems finding common ground with people you don't know. If that's the case, I would suggest looking for organizations based around a particular interest (this won't be so tough if you're in college).

The point is, it *IS* your job as an employer to make sure the ID is valid.  Government can and should help you in that endeavor. With recent advancements in technology, ID can be verified better, faster, and more accurately than ever before, but the responsibility for verifying it lies with *you.*

Why? For one, unscrupulous employers and desperate employees will cheat the system. Employers take advantage of these workers by lowballing the value of their labor, and desperate employees will take what they can get.  All of this equals off-the-books income, and the business owner should no longer be able hide behind feigned ignorance: ""Duhhhh . . . but I didn't know his photocopied ID was a *fake*! I ain't responsibie!"" These are typically the people that piss and moan that the ""gubbermint"" is robbing them blind, even as they lie, cheat, and steal from the rest of us by dodging their taxes.

Yes, it is your responsibility as an employer to ensure that your employees are legal.  That's part of the package of responsibilities you signed on for when you opened your door for business.

It's all irrelevant, because the Arizona law can never be enforced even if it were Constitutional, which it isn't.

Immigration has always been good for our country in the past, and it remains the lifeblood of our economy now.  Unfortunately, capitalism can never work without a fresh supply of cheap labor to exploit; and if it won't come to us, we'll send our factories to them, as we have in China.

American business is saving on their labor expense by a factor of at least ten by exploiting Chinese workers—how much of that have you seen in price reductions in Chinese-made goods? We all know the good honest business owners of the world just *love* to pass on the savings, right?

Colorado, as a whole, is pretty conservative, but Boulder and Ft. Collins are not (some may disagree with me about Ft. Collins--depends, I guess).

I, too, was raised in a very conservative house. My parents have had a rough time adjusting to their sons lives, which are... normal. I think parents often create a world for their children that is easy to understand, and over the years, they accidentally come to believe that it is real.

If he did all that, then his punishment would be more reasonable.

All this kid did was successfully guess her Yahoo! password reminder question.  This is something that requires little skills that even an 8 year old could do.  If somebody else can guess the answer to your question, then the owner of the e-mail account ought to be punished for stupidity.  However, I keep forgetting we don't punish stupidity in this country.  Plus I'm just speaking from a cyber security standpoint.  In reality, Kernell shouldn't have been punished this severely.

I know the difference.

&gt; I'm not taking a 'side' on any political issue

And I know you're not a bloody Republican- stop trying to make this a two party issue.

&gt; The answer is no, no you should not.

This is the point of contention. You keep asserting that because I think a certain group is full of the worst type of people that I should be unable to say that a group of people are full of the worst type of people.

It's obvious that most claims of this degree will be beyond what is 'fair', but this doesn't mean that all claims should be dismissed. By definition there are bad people out there, and they tend to gather in groups- our definitions of 'bad' is subjective but that also doesn't mean that such claims can be thrown out.

Out there, scattered around, are groups of truly disgusting individuals who, while perhaps decent as individuals, feed upon one another to reach depths nigh unimaginable.

I'm not saying that groups aligned to the left are not equally repugnant, but from all the information I have seen (taking all supportive and contradictory sources on as fair a scale as my flawed human perspective can give me) the teabaggers and birthers are some of the worst offenders of hypocrisy, hatred, and ignorance that I've seen.

I'm open to the possibility of something that changes this viewpoint. But just because people are prone to make these claims down party lines isn't going to stop me from making legitimate claims based on logical reasoning. ","1272681446"

I find that numerical problems are easier to understand if you draft them out in Excel. Excel is capable of doing matrix calculations (look at 'matrix formulas' in the help). 

Numerical approximations can be done by using one column for your indepent variable (time, x, etc), and incrementing by a constant step size each row, where the other columns involve your calculations that depend on the independent variable (ex. first derivative central difference formula). The last column will be used as an error column, and you can basically just select a row, drag the autofill and watch the error column until it approaches zero.

Once you know your problem is working well, implement it in Matlab using for/while loops, or whatever else is pertaining to the problem.","1272681535"

""Simpson said the data collected from the experiments is being used in a project in China, as faculty from PSUC are working with a leading Chinese epidemiologist and the Chinese Centers for Disease Control to establish national occupational noise standards.""
The article claims DoD need for blast injury, but what is the motivation for study described in the article? What is the justified need? What data is missing from the available international standards that justifies collecting more data?  I feel like that is an important detail that should have been stated. I think animal research is beneficial to the health of the people when there is a justified need.
Also, I imagine that the chinchillas may have psychological problems in addition to being deaf. No shit right. So even if anyone is willing to take the animals in, the chinchillas would have some major issues like an ex bf/gf with baggage.

You're going to have to come to terms with the fact that you will not have everything the way you want unless you can foot the bill yourself.

I was in a similar situation myself. My husband and I are both atheists, but our families are both devoutly religious. Because most of the funding for our wedding came from them. We had to have the wedding in a church, performed by a minister--those were the terms. We chose a restored old historical church that is only used as a wedding chapel. We selected a liberal Methodist minister who was very cool. We got to read through and approve the exact wording of the ceremony beforehand. But besides the church and the minister, everything else (the readings, music, programs) was secular. Overall, everyone was happy with the event.

Dude, you're going to have to spend holidays with these people as your in-laws from here on out, you're going to have to compromise and not piss them off (too much). You don't have to convert or promise to raise your kids in the church, but setting foot inside a church isn't going to make you burst into flames (my hubby and I have tested this; we are still here).

If you've got the money, you can have your own wedding with friends at another time. My hubby and I were already married by a JP when our church wedding rolled around, so we didn't care as much. Maybe you can explore the options of having a second party.","1272681668"

I find myself drawn to Linux because of package managers which are able to update all programs inside the system simultaneously without the need of adding several processes to the startup list.

"politics","t5_2cneq","You mention quite a few topics here, I'm going to try and respond as concisely as I can, and provide some links if you're interested.

First, the Tragedy of the Commons.  I think this concept supports my side of the argument - collectively owned resources are depleted quicker and are used in a must less efficient way than privately owned resources.  Overfishing or poaching would no longer be a problem if waterways and more land was given to private owners.  This can be extrapolated to any public service.  For some more info on how privatizing ocean and waterways could work, check out this [paper](http://mises.org/journals/scholar/waterprivate.pdf).


Equating public services with the Prisoner's Dilemma.  You say that an individual that does not pay for a public service hurts you somehow.  You seem to assume that because the government has a coercive monopoly on services such as roads or police that this is the only way they can be provided.  It would be similar to if we lived in a society that had arranged marriages and not being able to figure out how couples would get together without being forced.  Entrepreneurs, if given the opportunity, will figure the best way to provide these services.  Private police services would do a better job than the current system.  They would actually have an incentive to protect people, as opposed to today where cops spend more of their time on victimless crimes than major violent crimes and have no incentive to actually try to prevent crime.  They're gonna get paid whether they do a good job or not: and whether you (the tax payer) like it or not.


These services aren't any more ""public"" than cellphone towers.  Well everyone needs these to talk w/ cellphones today, don't we?  How is it the free-market provided that?  Can you even imagine how fucked up telecommunications would be if the state-sponsored AT&amp;T monopoly weren't deregulated?  We'd still have black rotor phones with $10 a minute long distance and you'd be telling me in this thread - You gotta pay yer taxes so we can all use phones &amp; how would poor people get phones if the government didn't provide it?  


As for the rape victim scenario, I think anyone, professional police or not, would try to rescue the victim pro bono if they could.  It's similar to showing up to a hospital without insurance.  Back in the day, there was no guarantee that you'd be helped, but most people were.  Nowadays there is a law (at least in California) so people know if they show up, they are required to be treated.  Obviously more people abuse this system, which raises costs and makes people less responsible.


Next you mention cleaning up the current system.  You say that you have some libertarian leanings.  Well I'm sure you're aware of some of the brilliant libertarian minds of the past such as Ayn Rand or Murray Rothbard.  As brilliant as they were, the libertarian movement has been a complete failure if it's goal were to reduce government.  Look a the record: Government has ALWAYS grow with few exception, such as after big wars.  The reason goes back to the original thread, because there is an organization we call government that is allowed to use violence to force people to obey, whether it's handing money over or going off to kill strangers in another country.

Laissez-Faire.  When comparing the most prosperous nations, the ones that respect property rights and are allowed the most freedom tend to prosper the most.  Unfortunately for the US, these ideals have been diminishing over at least the past 100 years in favor of more socialism and government control over the economy.  Despite this, respect for private property is much stronger here than most countries, especially third world countries like in Africa and some in South America.  Socialist dictators control land and impress young people to fight in their armies.  The answer to worldwide starvation, disease and poor education isn't to give them more of our money.  These countries/cultures need property rights and freedom, then people will be willing to invest in capital which will increase productivity and lead to a higher standard of living.  Now, don't get me wrong, I don't know how to accomplish this, but throwing money at the problem won't help.  Look at how much aid is sent to Africa and there seems to be little improvement.  I think the aid hurts more than it helps, mainly because the aid is typically given to the corrupt government which probably spends more on guns to further oppress their people rather than help them.  And what kind of help is it to just give a hand-out?  This may breed dependency?  Much better to invest in capital, such as farming or infrastructure or a factory.  Check out this movie about [free market/globalization](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=5633239795464137680#)


Ok, I feel like I'm starting to ramble, and I've failed in trying to stay concise.  One last thought though, I do respect your opinion for wanting to have a single organization that you pay money to which provides, roads, police service, courts, etc.  And I would never advocate using violence against you to prevent you from acting on that opinion.
However, I disagree with your opinion for the reasons, amongst others, cited in this post.

Now, are you willing to extend to me the same courtesy I extended to you and allow me to act on my opinions without violence being used against me?

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","&gt; Personal checks are still the easiest way to deal with large transactions and smaller parties, like giving your rent to your landlord or reimbursing a friend.

_In the US_. I'm in the US for a one-year stay at the moment. I had never in my life seen a check before. I am currently 24 years old - grew up in Germany, lived a few years in Lebanon, and started university in Finland. In none of those countries have checks been used routinely for a very long time now.

I am most familiar with the Finnish system, which I gather is also very common in most of the EMU. Everything is based on wire transfers. They are free within the country. They post immediately to accounts in the same bank, and next business day for accounts in different banks. To transfer money, you just need to know the account number.

So, say you want to pay rent. You just go online and deposit x amount of funds to the account of your landlord. This is also works for transferring money to your buddies, or any other bank account. Nothing special required. All bills are paid this way. Your corporate reimbursements get paid to you that way. Nothing special needed for direct deposit, it's the standard way.

In general I'm still rather surprised by how old fashioned the US banking system is. Various friends from across the EU agree, so it's not just me.

"lgbt","t5_2qhh7","My suspicion is that few gay or bisexual men feel immediately attracted to the idea of anal sex.  Here's the progression of my sexuality which closer mirrors that of many gay men I've spoken to:

* First I masturbated to the idea of having sex with women because I just assumed I was straight; the possibility that I was gay didn't really occur to me.
* Little by little, I realized that what I was focusing on in my fantasies was the man and his penis and not the woman.  By this time masturbation sessions were becoming quite arduous endeavours.
* On a whim I tried masturbating one day to the thought of naked men and I found it much more pleasureful and finished much earlier than usual.  I never turned back.
* I started looking at porn and, at first, limited myself to looking at naked men, since society had done a rather good job of instilling in me a disgust with anal sex and other more extreme or unusual sexual acts. (I was about 13 at the time.)
* In the same period, I was convinced that I would never want or have a romantic relationship another man.  Eventually, though, I realized that when I contemplated the concept of the homosexual romantic bond, stereotypical Hollywood depictions of gay couples would enter into mind and that was what I found objectionable.  Gay male couples as far as I had known were always emotionally distant, taciturn, and generally just... off in various ways.  I decided, then, to create my own idea of gay romance, one far more agreeable to my tastes, whereupon I set out to find out whether my ideal was ever observed in the real world; fain did I discover that it was (somewhat rarely, but there are instances).
* The more I was exposed by accident to gay porn depicting anal sex and the more that I perceived that it was typically clean and didn't involve ""fudge packing"" as the eponymous epithet suggests, the more comfortable with the idea I became until finally I felt a strong desire to participate.

I can perfectly well understand the disinterest in anal sex.  Penetration of a male is thought to be emasculating.  By refusing to participate in anal sex, some might feel that the masculinity of both partners would be preserved and thus their sexual appeal would also.  Some gay men prefer their men more butch than others; there's nothing wrong with that.  I recall a statistic that says that either 60% or 40% of gay men only indulge in anal sex.  It's not as common as many think.","1272681801"

Part of his thesis is that who you are (personality wise) and how you react to situations on a day to day basis is more of a result of external forces than you realize.  Your personality will be in a constant state of flux all day, every day for your whole life.

He also makes some powerful arguments that most of the standard tests and various catagorizations that psychology and sociology have been churning out are far too narrow to give any real insight into who we really are.  We are way too complicated, and in a way *undefinable.*","1272681826"

"wow","t5_2qio8","If you're interested, here are same basic tips for warrior tanking:

If you see a caster or archer in a group of mobs, you can make them come to you if you use a ranged attack, then immediately run behind a corner.  This will allow you to gather up all mobs easily for building threat.

Try to start each fight with a big threat ability, so DPS doesn't accidentally pull aggro.  Shield Slam followed immediately by Thunder Clap is a good way to build initial threat until you learn Shockwave.

After the initial pull, prioritize Shield Slam, Revenge and Devastate on your main target. Use Thunder Clap for all other mobs.
If DPS is not focus firing (which is quite common in PUGs), then you may have to swap targets occasionally.
Don't worry about getting Sunder to 5 stacks unless it's a boss... mobs generally die too fast to worry about that.

Try to familiarize yourself with Blizzard's marking system.
If you mark targets (at the very least learn how to mark Skull), it will generally make fights go more smoothly.","1272681839"

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","Not saying I agreed with the proposition that race is morally relevant, but rather that it doesn't seem to be a sufficient condition for designation of morality, whether you can justify it morally in your own context (since, I'm sure, many people **CAN** justify it morally within their own worldview... doesn't necessarily make it morally so, lest we defer to moral relativism).

What I'm pushing for is for a general set of conditions by which something should qualify as justifiable upon which to thrust moral value.  Even if there exists no single universal set, is there a population of sets within which morality can be established from axiomatic principles?

Further, I do take issue with your assessment that the onus is on positive determination of morality, rather than the opposite.  This is circumstantial, based on the generally-accepted social norms of the community in question.  I don't think many people agree with the Catholic church's implicit arguments that their actions to hide and protect abusive priests are not morally relevant to their moral authority; it is more commonly accepted, and perhaps even considered a moral universal, that it is NOT up to the general population to prove that pedophilia is morally relevant (i.e., it's practically a universal given that it **IS** morally relevant), and thus the Church's case (a poor one at that) is to prove that it is not morally relevant.","1272681943"

I wore running shorts that were sort-of a nylon or other synthetic material that had an inner ""underwear"" shorts built it, but it was made of the same material, not cotton.  I remember noticing my weenie flopping up and down quite a bit.  Once I noticed it, I got hard, off to one side.  I kept running, to finish my distance.  I was about 20 minutes into the jog (about 5 minutes into the erection), and BAM: the floodgates opened.  It was kinda psychedilic.  I just kept running.  I didn't care if anyone figured out what was happening.  I was already covered in sweat, and my jogging shorts were soaking wet as well.  Looking down, I could tell the difference between sweat and cum, so I reached down and smeared the front of my shorts to even out the wetness.  Made it back to the gym, grabbed my stuff and went home without showering -- afraid I'd look obvious.  Never happened again, though, no matter how many times I tried.  Guess it was just one of those gifts to cherish and not question.

Your idea is pretty simple, but does not take into effect that even in deep ocean water is not static, it has a current. This would make the flow of the oil unpredictable (this is even without taking into effect the natural resistance of the water and the oil spreading as a result) and make a need for this design to go all the way to the ocean floor. Now, i dont know about this particular problem we have now, but many oil rigs drill down thousands of feet. This would make manufacturing and transportation of this a nightmare. Also, you would generally have to make it so it either bypasses the area of the oil rig (meaning fits over it) or has a shape that allows it to be put in place without moving the presumably damaged oil rig. 

Short version: I like when people think (keep it up) but in general the scale would be to huge to implement. It would be the equivalent of dropping a hollow building on top of the oil rig.

I just heard the beautiful voice of my dead mother echoed in your sentiment, saying... ""If they jumped of a bridge would you?..."" (thanks for that pleasant memory).  Seriously if you are going to emulate someone would you not try to emulate someone worth emulating and not a corrupt incompetent government?  Crime is down in Saudi Arabia, lets start caning women who our elders consider are dressed indecently, or better yet cutting the hands of thieves, or stoning the adulteress.  There is one universal truth ( at least in my demented universe ) and that is this: ""The ends can never justify the means"", an oldie but a goody. Situational ethics can never get you anywhere but a dark place. Emulating even effective savagery is nothing but savagery.    

&gt; The majority of Americans live paycheck to paycheck just like Mexicans do. I have worked in car washes (Where I was the minority and treated like shit), dishwasher, waiter, laborer, and a lot of other lowly jobs. I sure saw a lot of Americans at those jobs, they didn't seem to think the work they were doing was beneath them

You may not be typical, nor did I say that hard honest labor was beneath all Americans.  However I guarantee you that you offer a menial job to 100 unemployed Americans who may be two weeks into collecting unemployment insurance and I bet you dollars to donuts that greater than 60% of them would rather wait it out.

&gt; Maybe the US and Arizona should mirror Mexico's immigration laws and penalties. Would that be fair?

No, Arizona should solve their crime problem by being creative, being aggressive but not by scapegoating a whole social sector just to quell their paranoia. 

&gt; Now, best case scenario we evolve to the point where we realize our collective consciousness unites us spiritually and we live globally as universal citizens with no world hunger, wars, borders and governments.

That would be wonderful but for now maybe a little respect and common sense would be enough.

This was intended as a counter point for people saying that need meat for a balanced diet, and therefore keeping meat is a choice.

&gt; I also understand that you feel it's ""most natural"" to be vegan.

Not in a long shot. The most natural diet would be one where 90% of the energy intake is from gathered whole foods such as vegetables, nuts, eggs, fruits, and berries etc. The other 10% of energy intake would come from meats.

My comments around the benefits of a vegan diet are based around it being more beneficial in terms of population wide sustainability and efficiency in terms of production. A vegan diet is an environmentally friendly diet, not a more natural/evolved diet.

The commentary on dairy and grains was more to illustrate that these 'staples' are very new to us as a species in terms of diet. They are mostly a product of the agricultural evolution. I am not to suggest that they are bad (dairy farming aside), but they illustrate that radical shifts in our diet are possible, and can be considered quite normal in a short amount of time. This goes on to point out that just because some are not ready to try and consciously adapt their diet to one that is more environmentally friendly, then they shouldn't give others crap for pioneering the way and giving it a go.","1272682267"

The IRS will take your tip log and in fact that's the point of it. Your complete tip log supersedes anything your employer provides unless your employer is reporting higher credit card tips than you report in total tips. That's the point of the tip log and how you deal with any potential tip audits.

Just because your boss, national chain or not, is an idiot does not change the legality of requiring you to claim income that you did not in fact get. So yes the IRS will believe you got less than that if you show them and if you don't your boss has to prove you got as much as they are saying you did.

If you were ever shorted on wages you need to go down to the DOL. They will sort out the trouble and you will get your proper pay. It's your fault if you didn't do that not anyone elses for not tipping. You'd have a huge lawsuit available to you for this where you'd recuperate lost wages plus a punitive addition.

*This offer http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/by9es/reddit_im_being_kicked_out_of_my_home_because_i/c0p602u *

I would seriously suggest the offer that was in the United States. While going overseas is fun it is also very stressful. Culture shock from going overseas is not going to help you adjust and on top of still getting to know who you are it very well might break you. I was kicked out of the house after my Junior year of High School (18th Birthday) so I can somewhat relate.

In addition you really need to think about the long term. You head out to Scotland and your travelling visa expires you have an expensive plane ticket or illegal alien status, plus no real education to stand on. So take the other offer and learn from this experience. Some of the worst days of my life were spent sleeping on a friends floor barely trying to make ends meet, you're being given an opportunity to stay in a state you're somewhat familiar with and go to college, take it.

Also file an appeal with the college you wanted to attend stating that you have irreconcilable differences with your parents. If approved (which if you're telling the truth it will be) then that will drop your Expected Family Contribution (EFC) to zero. This will get you the bare minimum of a Pell Grant for 5500 or so and with free room and board you can easily pay for your own meals at least.

Most of all good luck man, sometimes you get dealt a shitty hand but you just need to make some smart decisions, appreciate what you're being offered, and work hard.

Edit: That's bare minimum 5,500, you can easily get state grants, low interest and subsidized loans, etc.","1272682386"

What if Reddit Island were partly created as a place of learning? Even just certain times of the year it could function as an unconference where members sign up to offer their expertise, give talks, run seminars and training sessions in areas such as: programming, technology, design, science, religious and philosophical studies, AI, business, politics, marketing, women's studies... name it.

The ""conference"" would be very fluid, with a democratically-decided agenda, loose scheduling, and lots of time in between sessions for lively discussions with other redditors. 

This would allow people to visit on work time, possibly with their company/university paying for some of the travel, and/or make it a tax deductible experience. And -- to me, this is the heart of why I'd want to meet with other Redditors. What we all have in common is an interest in learning about the world around us. 

It's like a non-stop real life university.

You deny that I am a skeptic, but my very skepticism is what has lead me to my beliefs. Everything I believe is found in science, I do not believe in a flying spaghetti monster. I am convinced that I am not mere amalgamation of my cells. I (note that I am referring to a thing here) transcends the things I am made of.

Science does indeed have a hard time with my interpretation of life, people always want to tell me the biological definition of life, but you cannot define the thing with itself. Biology is merely the study of life, not the definition of it.

Chemical energy is a very shitty way to see life. If you pile all the vitamins and chemicals found in food into an IV drip, you will eventually waste away. What chemicals do you eat that you call food? Even MSG comes from life. I do not eat chemicals to survive, I eat living things.

"politics","t5_2cneq","Yea and they are an unstable theocracy working on nuclear weapons, maybe that has something to do with the unanimous UN support against Iran's nuclear program. It has long since passed just being the US, Iran is even losing China and Russia at this point. You can't expect all that much from a theocracy in my opinion it's a general rule of thumb that the world should not let young and unstable religious states have nuclear weapons.

We all know the religious radicals are among the most dangerous people on earth, just look at the Christians here in the US rallying for Palin and imagine if they have their own nation with nuclear weapons. It's that bad in Iran, but it has the potential to be because it's a theocracy. It could shift rapidly to any point that the clerics coordinated their society toward. Their influence might not last, but it would probably be enough for a small group of radicals to launch a nuclear weapon. 

Most nations with nuclear weapons are more stable, more organized and controlled by some type of election process. I don't feel comfortable with theocracies having nuclear weapons I feel they are the most one of the most erratic type of governments you can have and Islam is not an entirely non violent religion. Perhaps if it was a theocracy of Buddhists I would feel more comfortable, but Jews, Christians and Muslims seem to have a history of getting into bloody conflicts over ideologies. 

Iran's theocracy will fall in time,  but it might not go out peacefully if you look at how the government handled the recent protests I think it's clear Iran is not ready for nuclear weapons and the UN does have the power to fairly easily stop their advancement at minimal cost. Sanctions are the first step, but if they continue to become less stable while making significant process to a launch-able weapon the right thing to do is to enforce the UN policies as law using military force when necessary. 

It's nothing against Iranians, just their recently overthrown government and it's lack of checks and balances or accountability of any kind. It's bad enough Pakistan and N. Korea have nukes, we should have stopped them before it happened as well now they can launch missiles at Japan for fun and there is less and less anyone can do about it without fear of somebody getting nuked. 

Iran really doesn't need nuclear power, it's not cost effective compared to using their vast supplies of natural gas which is cheap and very quick and easy to setup as a power plant. Nuclear is expensive, dangerous, and dirty. They have access to huge amounts of solar power and likely wind as well, easily enough to power their nation and cheaper than nuclear in both the short term and by far in the long term.","1272682516"

"science","t5_mouw","Well, the man does have a point, although I think his reasoning is being misconstrued a bit. To me, it sounds like what he's saying is that if we ever make contact with an advanced alien species, that will be the end of our culture; on that, I tentatively agree.

**Worst case scenario:** They are evil, capital ""E'"" evil! They steal our women! They exploit our planet! It's *Mars Attacks!* all over again. They get their kicks by bullying lesser civilizations! Or any variation of the above. End result: We are screwed.

**Best case scenario:** This, to me, is less clear-cut. Suppose there's this alien culture that has managed to advance to a level where they can travel the stars. They likely have overcome war, racism, and all the other petty squabbles that keep on keeping us back. They probably also have developed advanced cybernetics and bioinformatics and transformed their very bodies into... well, just imagine what we would do if we were masters of genetic manipulation and man/machine interfaces. The possibilities for leaps in evolution are endless.

To me, that spells cultural assimilation: The aliens' way of life proves to be far superior than our way of doing things. We completely adopt the aliens' culture, and all of human history becomes essentially as obsolete as the stories of how you used to shit your diapers when you were a baby. We're not doomed, but our culture and way of live are essentially thrown to the same junk pile as the eight track, or minidisc players.

Of course, the best case scenario could also involve a civilization that tries to foster other cultures along desired paths while conserving as much of their identity as possible. Like I said, it's not all that clear cut.

At the end of the day though, it's all speculation. But given the possibilities, erring on the side of caution sounds like a good idea.","1272682534"

Waterproofing is also essential and not mentioned at all.  Sure, you have to fill in any cracks in the concrete on the inside, but those blocks are pretty porous.  You will need to take several steps to keep the water out, including a layer of tar on the outside and thick (really thick) plastic over top of that.  That will prevent water from coming through the walls, but you also need to get rid of any water that pools there or it will cause you problems somewhere.  You will want to tie into the existing foundation drain system if you can, which is probably that old clay drain tile stuff (probably clogged in your 40's era house anyway).  Top all that with lot of gravel and clean fill.

You also need to tie the new wall into the existing structure.  Otherwise the only thing keeping the new walls from collapsing inwards is the poured roof.  You can do that by drilling into the house and the shelter, filling the holes with construction adhesive and then hammering rebar into those holes, then just tie that into your new wall.

I wonder if it was just wood so that the former owner could pull it in event of a home defense emergency - you know, zombies coming in or whatever.  There's undoubtedly at least one emergency exit from the shelter so you don't need the house passthrough to get out.  If you intend to keep the room for similar purposes you should keep that in mind - think about what you would do if you knew about your neighbor's shelter, 6 month food and water supply, etc. in the event of an emergency.

Good luck - awesome project!","1272682684"

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt; You really think those 'college students' held American diplomats 444 days against the wishes of the Islamic republic?

I think the seizure of the embassy was a semi-spontaneous act by mostly young hotheads. As to the long-term aspects, see below.

&gt; Was there some kind of siege?

It is common for various US embassies around the world to have to endure scores of protesters outside their walls -- often for extended periods. Such is the feelings of many ""common people"" towards the US gov't and its criminal foreign policy.

&gt; Did the Iranian government negotiate the release and apologize to the United States for the actions of the college students?

Ask the Iranian leader of that time! He has said publicly that he negotiated with President Carter *and* with the Reagan election team to work out a deal. And he has said plainly that he took the deal that was best for Iran -- that being Reagan's deal, which meant the hostages had to be kept imprisoned until *after* Reagan took office.

If you look back at when the hostages were released, they were sitting on an airplane for a long period of time, and that plane was not allowed to take off; not until literally minutes after Reagan took office. In the following days American weapons started being shipped by airplane from Israel to Iran as part of the deal (we know this not only from the Iranians but also because one plane crashed in a third country).

President Carter has said publicly that he heard that the Reagan election team was negotiating with the Iranians, and Carter's nat'l security head wrote a book on the topic. Russian (then-Soviet) and French intelligence reported meetings of Reagan's people with Iranians in Paris.

Can you really blame the Iranian gov't for taking the best deal?

&gt; Did any of those college students serve time in an Iranian prison for their actions?

Not that I know of. Once the embassy takeover occurred and the Iranian revolutionary gov't took control of the situation, I'm sure the Iranian gov't just loved having some leverage to get spare parts for their US-made weapons to fight off the US-backed Saddam Hussein's invasion of Iran.","1272682688"

The other possibility is that they mean AI-ish techniques - hairy and/or heuristic search, NLP and so on.

"Fantasy","t5_2qknd","S.L. Farrell's ""Cloudmages"" series is one of my favourite undiscovered gems. Has political drama, family drama, epic magic and military battles, and a really rich irish/celtic theme.

Has anyone else heard of, or read it?

The first book was written in 2001-ish so it seems to fit your requirements, and I love it so I'm recommending it wholeheartedly.

He's also done another series called the Nessantico series (""A Magic of Twilight"", ""A Magic of Dawn"", etc.) but I didn't really get into that as much, it's a very different setting, somewhat Italian flavoured and significantly more ""Renaissance"" than ""Medieval"", with a lot of distinct religious overtones (and undertones, and midtones). Also leaned towards the politics a lot more, and less towards the magic. Not bad I suppose, but it didn't really do it for me, personally.

edit: Just thought of another pretty modern series that I somewhat enjoyed... it's also a good and long one that will keep you busy for a very long time if you like it. Ian Irvine's books, starting with ""Geomancer"" and the Well of Echoes quadrilogy, and moving on to the Song of Tears quadrilogy(I think?)... and these are *thick* books. Like I said, they will keep you going for awhile.

The only downside is that, while I haven't gotten to the end yet, I've gotten through I think 6 of the books, and every book ends with the world and the (very humanly flawed) heroes in a worse state than when they started. Usually much, much, *much* worse. Little scraps of hope get tossed in along the way and then shortly afterwards all hope gets violently crushed with an iron boot. If you're easily depressed or become very attached to the characters, this may not be the series for you. :P","1272682697"

"Music","t5_2qh1u","I've been singing chorally since middle school, now I'll be starting on my 3rd year singing with an a cappella group at my college. Here's some tips:

1. Sing all the time and experiment with your ranges. The only way to improve your low end or falsetto is to use both. A lot. Sing in the shower, along with the radio, while cleaning the house, etc etc etc

2. You Tube some choral warm ups, simple up and down the scale works. Do these everyday before you sing to improve intonation and get used to maneuvering your voice.

3. DO NOT STRAIN. Starting out, tension in your throat is HORRIBLE if you don't know how to control it. To avoid tension, you need to support your singing (see point 4)

4. BREATHING. If there is one thing I know singers need to fix, it is breathing. I was told I had been breathing wrong for 17 years of my life. You have to breathe from the diaphragm, nice deep stomach-expanding breaths. Your chest shouldn't move. Lay on the ground, put a book on your stomach, and try to focus on breathing that moves the book up and down. Make this breathing a habit. Then, when you sing, breathe deep and WORK THOSE ABS.
When you support your singing with a nice strong airflow, your lungs do the work so your vocal chords don't have to. This means less strain, and a healthier voice that will be more powerful in the long run. ","1272682827"

The new OpenGL is much harder. You have to do everything yourself. It is also necessary to get the performance seen in high end games.

If what you said was true, the mathematical proof would be trivial, in fact, I'd point out fermat's theorem is only concerned with n&gt;2, so what you said would amount to a proof.

The truth is, as you increase c, the distance between 2(c-1)^n and c^n decreases and eventually, 2(c-1)^n is going to be bigger than c&gt;n.

ok, so, a^n + b^n = c^n.

We let the left hand side be the largest it can be, that is, we let both a and b = c-1.

so the left hand side = 2(c-1)^n.
The right hand side is equal to c^n.

we divide the right hand side by the left hand side.

We then obtain, (1/2)*((c-1)/c)^n. Whenever the right hand side is bigger than the left hand side, this value will be bigger than 1 and less than 1 when smaller.

We see that as c goes to infinite our value goes expression goes to 1/2. That is, as we increase c, our right hand side is going to approach being exactly half the amount of the left hand side.

Think about it this way, as c goes really big, c-1 is basically c. So we basically get 2C^n on the left hands side.

We all know full well that cops get away with a hell of a lot, all the way from speeding to drunk driving to murder, and we should all agree that it is wrong that they receive preferential treatment.

But on the other hand, we have more rights against police interference in our lives than most other places in the world.

You can believe in either extreme, but the fact is that a balance between a safe and organized society and a police state is a very fragile line, and difficult to maintain without the occasion dip to one side or the other.","1272682859"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I love doing this. One time in Texas, a jerkoff in a pickup changed lanes into me. I honked and braked, and he swerved away, but then quickly served back into my lane since I was behind him. Then he flipped me off, which was hilarious. I guess I was wrong to honk at him when he almost caused a wreck. 

Anyway, I flipped him off, and left my arm out the window way longer than was appropriate, then retracted it. I then changed lanes and started to pass him. As I was about to pass him, he sped up to match my speed, honked his horn and mouthed the words ""fuck you"" and flipped me off again. He waited for me to react, and so I made an extremely exaggerated sad face and traced the path of a tear down my cheek then mouthed the words ""awwwww so sad.""

At this, he went ballistic. I saw his face turn beet red and saw him start screaming something at me from behind his window. He sped up and around me, swerved into my lane again, then slowed down to 30 in a 70. Anytime I tried to pass him, he'd swerve around and slam on his brakes to try to get me to hit him. He caused a three-lane traffic jam.

I wasn't in any hurry, so I just went 30 in a 70 until he got tired of being an asshole and drove off.

"science","t5_mouw","Thanks for your input! I did some basic calculations and at 5000 barrels a day, that's 148 gal/min or about 2.5 gal/sec - not a huge continuous flow rate. Hell you could easily flow that through just 6"" PVC (500gpm easy). Would still need a way to stabilize it but anchoring to a few tethered buoys up top and then to the sea floor via cables at the bottom should do the trick. A 6"" shaft should be very easy to maneuver to the precise site of the leak, then you'd just need an umbrella-like ""hood"" to scoop up the oil. Since there is no pressure difference between the inside of the pipe and the surrounding water, it does not need to be made of anything special.

But yes the idea is precisely to go right to the source of the leak so it can be captured with a high degree of accuracy.

Edit: It could even be *flexible* tubing. ","1272682876"

You have someone behind you that pushes you to the max. I know that in many ocassions I would've called off a gym session early if it wasn't for my trainer.

No.  It doesn't.  It makes you a trespasser.  For it to be burglary, there must be a demonstrated intent for the offender to have wanted to commit a serious crime when inside.  Also, if you enter without intent - e.g. you trespass and only on getting inside do you see the hope diamond laying on a table and decide to walk off with it then - it is not burglary.

"Pets","t5_2qh6o","$600 sounds quite steep. I would check out several other vets. Promeris (anti mite medication), mediated baths, and cephalexin (antibiotic) should take care of the problem. Promeris will kill the mite that causes demodectic mange. It will probably take multiple doses to totally kill of the mange. You will want regular skin scrapes to make sure. Medicated baths can speed up the process. Depending of the severity of of your dogs case, she may also need cephalexin to take care of any secondary infections.  

Promeris runs under $20 (I think I paid $8 when one of my fosters broke out, but I got a discount for being an employee of the local humane society) an application and is generally administered every two weeks. Cephalexin costs your vet almost nothing, so you shouldn't have to pay too much for that. At my shelter we use chlorohex (medicated shampoo) in only the most severe cases. While it is effective, it is also expensive ($100 - $200 a gallon, we get it in bulk you won't need nearly that much).  Skin scrapes can be a little more pricy, but the total for drugs, skin scrapes, and vet visits should be nowhere near $600. $100 to $200 for the entire treatment is much more reasonable. When my foster had an out break I spent at most $60 (although I got a discount).

I have no experience with home remedies for demodectic mange. The cost of treating it properly is not that large so I would treat it properly.

tl dr: Your vet is charging you way too much, shop around.","1272682963"
"apple","t5_2qh1f","Flash is overused.  There are sites I go to that use flash just for text headings, there is no need.  I shouldn't need to rely on a 3rd party plugin for simple things like text headings.  Even on the desktop flash has issues and will not load sometimes.  I have run into sites where all I want to do is find out the hours they are open and either the flash doesn't load or the site is so crazy, flashy, noise, and hard to use that I go somewhere else.     

You say there is no tool for WYSIWYG HTML5, I see this as an opportunity for Adobe.  They make tools for design and this would be a tool would be huge.  Basically you are talking about an upgrade to Dreamweaver, or they as Marco (of tumblr and Instapaper) posted they could repurpose Flash (the dev platform) for HTML5 with a fallback to flash for legacy support.  Probably won't happen, but would be cool.    

As an end user Flash sucks.  Before this recent wave of flash hate people were installing flash blockers like Click2Flash.  This hate for flash isn't new.      

Flash isn't just an iPhone issue.  No phones currently have it, Adobe hasn't released it yet, so picking on the iPhone here doesn't even make sense.  Also the flash will have to be re-done to work well with touch interfaces.  I'd rather see as a user, and as a developer, 1 site.  HTML5 that will work everywhere.      

Will HTML5 replace all the flash games, no.  I have seen some games done, but that is a ways off.  But for general browsing, dynamic content, video, etc it can do it.  It is like with anything on a computer, you want to make the user experience consistent and easy for the user.  99% of the time when flash is used for a page design it is to make the page unlike anything else out there, it is inconsistent, hard to use, and filled with mystery meat navigation.  In short, it is a poor experience that relies on a third party plugin, takes longer to load, and provides a single point of failure.  Not to mention it is hell from an accessibility standpoint if you have a disability and also causes issues if you are looking to get fully indexed by google and other search engines.       

Getting it to work well in all browsers is also becoming less of an issues.  Getting things working in WebKit and Firefox isn't a huge deal, that will cover all Firefox, Safari, Chrome, and a vast majority of phones.  IE is still a bit of an issue and might take some time, but that should be getting a lot better with IE9 judging by the latest blog post over there.      

As for games.  Games are always better if they are native and built for the device they are on.  This is especially true when you look at something like the iPhone with it's buttonless interface and accelerometers.  Look at the DS as well, would you want developers making games that with some 3rd party tool that would run everywhere, but only used 1 of your 2 screens?  Of course not.  People will say there are already 100+ games/app in the App Store made with Flash.  Yep, and they have a majority of 1 star reviews, have issues with alpha blending, and run at &lt; 12fps.  I haven't developed for the iPhone, but from what I hear it isn't that hard.  Take a few weeks and do it right, get it looking good and your frame rate to a usable level using OpenGL and Cocoa.  There is enough junk in the App Store as it is, I don't need a bunch of weekend copy/paste action-scripters dumbing their half assed garbage in while trying to make a quick buck.","1272682964"
"worldnews","t5_2qh13","The veils are a symptom of a culture that prevents women from participating. The veils themselves? Banning them won't do a damn thing to change this oppression.

Sometimes this is done for dramatic effect, e.g. ""She did it again!  This cat has peed on my coat for the last time!"" and that's OK, because the speaker immediately clarifies.  But regularly, people will start a conversation with me *strictly* using third person pronouns as if I haven't had an intervening thought since we left off yesterday.

In my not-so-hostile view, if you are of the type to break the legs of small animals, or let them languish in starvation and filth, then 3 years prohibition of ownership upon conviction is sending the message that ""they'll get better, or learn from the paltry fine imposed.""

The sentences imposed in these cases are weak due to the limp-wristed nature of animal protection laws currently. However, violation of court orders that might accompany these convictions begin to enter into the criminal penalty realm of failing to comply with a judicial order, where they can start to have some teeth and proper consequences.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","China, and neighboring India, are facing an incredibly dangerous situation, likely to result in horrific destruction.  Because of cultural factors, there is a great imbalance in the normal ratio of men and women.  Already there are 30-50 million men with no chance to ever be employed or marry, and the number is growing.

About the same time as the US Civil War, China was in a similar situation as they are today, in many ways, of building social pressure.  And all it took was one charismatic leader, who fancied himself to be ""Jesus' younger brother"", to create what was perhaps the second bloodiest conflict in world history, after World War II.  The Taiping Rebellion.  A civil war that killed perhaps 30 million people and lasted for 14 years.

The leaders of China still remember the Taiping Rebellion, and it rates right up there with the Cultural Revolution as horrific national disasters.  Another one of which is staring them in the face right now.

Bluntly put, all of these ""excess men"", and maybe many more, have to die.  The only choice is will they destroy their nation in the process, or will they just destroy each other where they can do the least harm?

Thus this demographic imbalance may be pushing both nations to war.  Not with their professional armies, but with conscript armies of immense size, armed just with rifles, each man being fed a pound of rice a day or less.  And the war doesn't end until the vast majority are dead.

Fighting in the desolate, high altitude mountain wastelands between the two nations, millions of men engaged in World War I style conflict, with just bullets and artillery to cull their numbers.  The professional armies remain in the second echelon, to stop any enemy breakthroughs.  And nuclear weapons are prohibited.

All it really takes is for one nation to start conscription, the rounding up of any male without a job or a wife.  The other nation will follow suit, since such vast numbers of infantrymen are very hard to defeat conventionally.","1272682992"

I stated that someone who claims to write about religion as a virus but fails to hold up a religious conversion cult like the 12 steps to critical, dispassionate scrutiny isn't much of a writer.

A few days ago he found the light regarding the 12 steps, but still found it necessary to opine that 12-step sponsorship is a wonderful thing. It isn't. 

My point is that AA has managed to infiltrate under the radar as it were because of uncritical goodwill from people like Mr. religionvirus.

After wasting my time perusing other equally insipid articles by this clown I've come to the conclusion that he's a low grade spammer who doesn't deserve a second look.

You can disagree with me, but this guy truly blows as a writer on the topic of religion being a virus. He's as credulous as any believer I've ever met, and just as pernicious.","1272683033"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","The thing is, the more technology advances, the greater the range of goods and materials that are more highly fungible.

Case in point; the development of steel made real estate more highly fungible by enabling vertical construction beyond four or five stories in height.  We are very soon going to face another such construction revolution in the form of industrial-construction carbon nanotube production.  Once they hit ~$6.00/Kg, they will be cost-equivalent (per unit volume) with steel.  But they will also be 1/10th the weight and 10x the strength (again, per unit volume).  Which will result in the same thing that steel did over stone and wood as construction materials. 

Advances in aeroponics/hydroponics and the recent focus on algaculture will also result in major development changes in how many feedstocks for hydrocarbon reserves are developed... with the incidental benefit that vegetable oil is vegetable oil, when you get down to it -- which means that corn will find itself with a major competitor which takes up less than 1/10th the land-mass for equivalent outputs.  And then you have the push for cultivated meat-tissues.  Finally (for this conversation anyhow), we are left with the question of where the energy for all this will come from.  If humanity starts getting desperate, there is at least one real-world solution that has existed for roughly fifty years now that could have pushed humanity into a post Type I (Kardashev scale, modern revision) civilization.  It is a combination of traditional solar-thermal steam power, Orion Project rocketry, and microwave-based beamed power.  A single such rocket, timed to meet a Near-Earth Orbit asteroid and capture it into orbit, along with the industrial equipment needed to do the manufacturing, could result in permanent human habitation of space... alongside more energy than is necessary to allow every single human being on the planet (currently alive anyhow) to run an arc furnace 24/7 their entire lives.

As I said in my previous comment:  Affluence and Population are just two of the three factors.  The third is *technology*.  And it is ramping up faster than I think the average person can even conceive of, nowadays.  And that **without** invoking Technological Singularity talk, or as-yet-unresolved physics.  These are all purely economic-scale industrial engineering problems.

I don't think it's OK to ignore your friends, people who've been there for you when you need it, just because you've got a hole to fuck now. Everyone's saying man up and deal with it, fuck that.

Cancer deaths are mutually exclusive. Just because 13% of total deaths in 2007 were due to cancer, it doesn't mean that in 2010 13% of total deaths will be due to cancer.

Toss a coin 10 times: if 9 out 10 tosses are heads, the next toss will either be heads or tails (50/50). In other words, past events have nothing to say about future events.

Again, the ratio is saying that 0.1% (yes, that's 1/10th of one percent) died of cancer in 2007 (out of the total population). I'm not saying anything else. No hidden agenda, no magical number.

"reddit.com","t5_6","&gt;Incidentally, you were quite quick in assuming abuse of power.

I misinterpreted the OP's message. I thought he said that he got rough treatment because of what he said, which is actually a completely understandable interpretation of this:

&gt;I told the arresting officer that I wanted to cum in his mother's mustache. Not recommended. The guards kind of 'forgot' about me for 48 hours. Jail taught me to not be an asshole.

How else would you interpret that? I think that both samcbar and myself were under the impression that the OP's insult got him in extra trouble, and you can't blame us for interpreting the OP's post that way. 

&gt;I think this is assuming a lot about the poster.

I don't. 

&gt;The point is that being nice to a cop can get you better/more humane treatment. Being an asshole can get you treated more roughly (without reaching ""abuse of power"" levels). Therefore the rational choice is to be nice, even if you (very naively) assume no possibility of power abuse.

Wow, you assume a lot. What if it gives you more pleasure to insult a cop than it does to get off with no jail time? Then the rational choice would be to insult the cop. 

Also, you are mistaken. Power abuse is treating someone differently based on how they treat you. For example, I'm a professor and one of my students is a suck-up and another is a jerk. I give the suck-up extra help and the suck-up does better on a test. I avoid the jerk as much as I can without violating any rules, and he does worse on a test. That's abuse of power despite the fact that actual rules aren't being violated. ","1272683258"

Bankers see if the company can get more money issuing debt or stock, whether a company should buy a competitor or buy back stock, what the optimal dividend payout ratio is.  IB's also help the company navigate the insane regulatory issues during the IPO period. 

Bankers get people to buy into Biotech startups by connecting companies with people looking for higher risk stocks.   Bankers save failing companies by getting a group of vulture funds to buy companies while they are bancrupt and bring the company back to life and saving countless jobs.

Fun aside: There are vector spaces defined using functions, with the inner (dot) product defined as some mathematical operation. For instance, the set of sin(n y 2 pi / T) (where n is an integer) are orthogonal using the inner product integral[0,T].

So (1/T) integral[0,T] sin (n y 2 pi / T) sin(m y 2 pi / T) dy

 thousands of years before they became totally new and unintelligible words.

But... that also gets me thinking... this is all assuming language on earth stays the same... and it wouldn't. So it probably wouldn't take more than a few hundred years considering. This is also based on my knowledge of the history of language change.

"RobotBuilders","t5_2rq02","Disclaimer: I am not a mechanical or electrical engineer.  I'll do my best to translate anyway.  By all means set me straight if I get something wrong.

&gt; The robot featured in the video used stepper motors

Stepper motors are a type of motor that can have their shaft controlled accurately; ie, you can tell it exactly how much you want it to turn rather than just flipping a switch on when you want it on.

&gt; connected to omniwheels

[Omniwheels](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omni_wheel) roll in both the ""normal"" direction and perpendicular to that direction (imagine a car that can roll sideways).  The ballbot needs them because the ball sometimes needs to roll perpendicular to one of the wheels.

&gt; to give the necessary control over the ball itself, which I thought was really clever. Stepper motors are quite easy to source from places like Anaheim automation or Lin engineering, or you just yank them from a printer or something.

Printers need stepper motors for the paper feed and print head arm, and people throw out printers all the time so it's pretty easy to find them.

&gt; Personally I would want three of the same kind to ensure that you got the necessary orthogonality in controlling the ball.

You want to get all the motors from the same place or else they might turn different amounts with each step, which is annoying to deal with.

&gt; The ones in the video appeared to be either nema 17 or nema 23 size,

NEMA 17 and NEMA 23 are two standard stepper motor sizes.

&gt; but this all depends on the scale at which you chose to build this. Driving stepper motors poorly is quite easy, you just apply the necessary pattern of currents to the coils and the motor just advances step by step. Driving them well is an entirely different story, especially because they have this tremendously annoying midband resonance issue.

First, [read how stepper motors work](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stepper_motor).  The faster you alternate the fields, the faster the shaft turns.  EDIT: THIS REST OF THIS WAS WRONG

&gt; For that I'd get a decent controller from either allegro semi or just buy a completed stepper controller from geckodrives. Mariss, the guy behind geckodrive has spent insane amounts of time honing his controllers, and on top of that he's an absolute analog engineering genius, so his drives are a safe bet. There also exist the issue of supplying the necessary voltages to the motors. Yes they say 5 volts, you'll want around 20 to 50 to get past di/dt limits of inductors.

""i"" is current, ""t"" is time, and inductors cause a damping effect in circuits so changes in voltage (ie, turning your stepper motor on/off) aren't propagated as quickly.  More voltage reduces the effect of the damping. (Maybe?  I'm not an expert on this.)

&gt; Most stepper motors controllers are step/direction. The main controller is really pretty unimportant. People always jump on arduinos as if they just finished half the project planning by figuring this out. It truly doesn't matter. Arm, pic,avr, just pick something that can implement your control loop fast enough.

ARM, PIC, AVR are different chip architectures commonly found in inexpensive hobbyist kits.

&gt; Also pick some imu board so the thing can figure out where it is and the angles and so forth.

IMU = Inertial Measurement Unit, a sensor that can detect movement and orientation.

&gt; Spark fun sells some pretty cheap. Power is going to be kind of a pain in the ass, I'd go with lipos and a boost supply to get the steppers their voltages.

Li-Po = Lithium-ion Polymer battery.  A boost supply increases the voltage from the 3.3V outputted by the battery to the 5V or whatever the stepper motors need.

&gt; As far as the frame goes, take a piece of sheet metal, cut it to be circular with 3 square tabs 60 degrees apart, and drill the tabs for the stepper motors and use a brake to bend the tabs up to 30 degrees. For smaller versions, you may try plexiglas and a hot wire bender.

[Hot wire bender](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjDhXiLOvnw&amp;feature=related)

&gt; Then you just drill holes for posts which should support trays for batteries, controller boards, etc.","1272683380"

Lethal injection -- Researchers examined post-mortem blood levels of anaesthetic and believe that prisoners may have been capable of feeling pain in almost 90% of cases and may have actually been conscious when they were put to death in over 40% of cases.

Also, doctors are not ethically allowed to participate in injections, so the procedure is often carried out by an inexperienced execution team. If the drugs are incorrectly injected, EXTREME pain can result. 


Electrocution -- U.S. Supreme Court Justice William Brennan once offered the following description of an execution by electric chair:
""...the prisoner's eyeballs sometimes pop out and rest on [his] cheeks. The prisoner often defecates, urinates, and vomits blood and drool. The body turns bright red as its temperature rises, and the prisoner's flesh swells and his skin stretches to the point of breaking. Sometimes the prisoner catches fire....Witnesses hear a loud and sustained sound like bacon frying, and the sickly sweet smell of burning flesh permeates the chamber.""


Firing squad -- If the shooters miss the heart, the prisoner dies by slowly bleeding out.


Hanging -- through any number of complications, the prisoner could effectively suffer through 45 minutes to an hour of strangulation.


Not to mention we're willing to torture alleged terrorists for information. If we as a nation see no problem with causing any amount of pain to human beings, why not just use them for scientific studies too? Perhaps give those on death row the option to participate in scientific studies if it means they might escape execution or be offered parole or something like that.

Uh, I wasn't asking as to whether protests ever occur anywhere.  I was asking if the Iranian government moved to free the hostages and return the US Embassy to its rightful owners.  The answer was no.

&gt;Ask the Iranian leader of that time! He has said publicly that he negotiated with President Carter and with the Reagan election team to work out a deal. And he has said plainly that he took the deal that was best for Iran -- that being Reagan's deal, which meant the hostages had to be kept imprisoned until after Reagan took office.

Why the hell would the Iranian leader negotiate with Carter to free people Carter isn't holding?  

&gt;Once the embassy takeover occurred and the Iranian revolutionary gov't took control of the situation, I'm sure the Iranian gov't just loved having some leverage to get spare parts for their US-made weapons to fight off the US-backed Saddam Hussein's invasion of Iran.

There's the conscious level, which is the realm of reasoning and the stuff you tell yourself and such things, and the subconscious level, which is more about feelings, and is the level that actually controls you.

They also say that if you ask your conscious brain why you do something, it comes up with lies that make it seem socially acceptable. This is what we call rationalization.

If you want the *actual* reason you do something, they say, you need to ask your *subconscious* mind. And here's how to do that: relax, think to yourself, ""What happens if I don't get this done?"", and wait for an answer to come to you. Don't try to figure out what the answer should be; just think.

Purchased a Samsung X460 laptop in March of 2009.

Returned it in June of 2009 for a failed hard disk.  Received it back 45 days later in July.

Returned it in September for a failed motherboard.  Received it back Nov. 1.  When I turned it on, it had a thick green line in the monitor that would not disappear, regardless of whether I was in Windows, or booting to a Linux Live CD.

Returned it in December (had to deal with it, as I needed the laptop).  I didn't receive it back for 2 months.

During this whole ordeal, Samsung tried all 3 times to tell me it wasn't covered under warranty.  It took an EECB to get these things repaired.

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt;What energy crisis are you talking about? If the crisis your talking about is that poor Americans may have to pay 3$/gal for gas then it's not a crisis at all.

I'm talking about the ""energy crisis"" that all the politicians are talking about. I don't think we have one and that science will give us new energy sources before it becomes that huge of a problem, but I may as well operate within the paradigm most people seem to accept. 

&gt;Maybe they should look at what European countries pay and decide that a 1+$ tax per gallon

Try more than that. Most euro countries pay upwards of 5-7 equivalent dollars / gallon. Keep in mind though, most of America has a population density that would make the rest of the western world smirk. That's why we consume so much more oil than everyone else - most of us can't catch the subway to work. 

&gt;No nuke plants built for 35-40yrs, freeway system 50-60yrs old, still living off black gold like 100yrs ago and finally just now giving permits for the first offshore wind farm. What was the reason behind that again?

The reason was that there were people of a certain political persuasion didn't want us to have nuclear power because they assumed since the communists couldn't do it right (chernobyl) that the rest of the world can't do it - now we rely on coal. As for wind farms, people of that the affore-alluded-to political persuasion were all for it until the deafening motors required to run them were built within a mile of their property and caused them to change their mind.

&gt;For a country that claims to be the most advanced in the world they seem to be falling behind and to cry “energy crisis” is just proof that they are out of ideas and ingenuity.

You're absolutely right - I hope we reverse this trend soon or we'll be heading the way of Rome. We haven't been the best at anything in a long, long time.

One example: when Harris says something like 'morality in this life is incompatible with the idea of an afterlife,' he interprets it to mean that it's literally impossible to be moral and believe in the afterlife, then points to all the moral people who currently believe in an afterlife. That kind of stuff litters the entire book.

"WTF","t5_2qh61","The ""cars are lethal weapons"" line is a get out of jail free card for trigger happy cops.  

Read about a cop named Lovelace in Chandler, AZ a few years back.  He *chased* a woman's car on foot, firing as he went, killed her, and got away with it.  (Initially charged with murder, then the usual police &amp; judge shenanigans downgraded the case until it went away.)

How?  Because he had to **step aside** to avoid being bumped on the leg as she drove away in a panic, having been busted at a drive-through pharmacy with a bogus prescription.  That stepping aside constituted ""a grave danger to the public if she were allowed to get away"" in Lovelace's mind, you see.

So he fired multiple shots into her car as she drove off...  **with her elementary-school-age daughter in the passenger seat.**

Risk killing a child, and definitely kill a young woman, to spare the public the hazard of being ""assaulted by a person who had 'tried to kill' a cop with 'a deadly weapon'.""

That sort of outrageousness **should** produce a 50,000 strong lynch mob in front of the courthouse and police station.  But it never does, of course, and every time it doesn't the police get bolder and feel farther above the law.

Five bucks says that BART cop who shot a kid in the back while he was lying face down gets off 100% before it's over.  Probably claiming some shit about how he thought he was using his taser.  (Anyone who has handled both knows they are designed to make such a mix up virtually impossible.)

EDIT:  I just checked for the latest on the BART cop case.  Yup, the circus has begun, and the *""I thought it was my taser!""* defense is already in play:

"linux","t5_2qh1a","I fear the very same. It's weird to read your post and _not_ disregard it as hyperbole, but such is life. Between Microsoft being sinister creeps and bullying Linux companies into patent deals and Apple evidently on some sort of berserker rampage, I think there is something more going on. As a single example, when Apple sued HTC, Microsoft not only came out in full support of the move, but actually [said](http://blogs.zdnet.com/microsoft/?p=6026) of it:

&gt;“In the next few years, as the IP situation settles in this space and licensing takes off, we will see the patent royalties applicable to the smartphone software stack settle at a level that reflects the increasing importance software has as a portion of the overall value of the device.  In the interim, though, we should expect continued activity.  Apple v. HTC was not the beginning of this process, and it isn’t the end of the story either.”

That's the wonderful vision of the future in the eyes of Apple and Microsoft. Endless bureaucratic licensing and lawsuits. Not only is this going to slow down the progress of mobile technology for decades to come, it's also going to kill new start-ups stone dead. Get used to the mobile operating systems we have now, because outside of cursory version updates, there are never going to be any more of them. 

It's a pretty bleak outloook, I know. I just don't see how things could get any better without, as ac3raven said, completely dismantling the software patent system. ","1272683575"

If the US got a few hundred GW of SBS out there, countries would be lining up to get in bed with us, since we'd be able to directly sell power to them directly when the satellite was out of US territorial view due to earth's rotation.

Yep, and solar has been improving in that time! The energy break-even time was ~30 years in the 70s, today it's around 6 months. I'm sure the economics have improved as well.

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt;I didn't make sweeping generalizations. I noted that I have seen very few liberals noting their opposition to Barack Obama or his policies, nothing about how ""liberals kiss Obama's ass"", as you suggested. In fact, I tried to stray away from generalizations.


Also you, two comments up:
&gt;The left and liberals love to point out the hypocrisy of the teabaggers and conservatives who didn't oppose George W. Bush's policies, but they are just as bad when it comes to Barack Obama.

To be fair, my language was stronger than yours. You didn't directly accuse anyone of kissing Obama's ass, so I put words in your mouth there. I used hyperbole.

As for this:

&gt;I definitely would not describe Reddit as critical of Barack Obama. Sure, as I pointed out I have seen some criticism of Barack Obama, but for the most part, critical articles and comments of Barack Obama and his policies are down voted, what I would describe inappropriately.

We'll just have to agree to disagree. The Reddit I've seen is very even handed towards Obama. Speaking strictly of the front page, I would say about half of the articles I've seen about Obama's presidency have been negative, and half positive. A similar mix can be found in the comments. Some days the top comment is about how he's a Corporatist whore and is breaking all of his promises, and on other days the top rated comment is complimenting his classiness.","1272683795"

"linguistics","t5_2qhos","I have no idea how to answer that question, so my comment is just pure speculation based on absolutely nothing at all, and I'm tired right now and my thoughts probably aren't lining up quite right as a result.

If you mean how long it would take to develop a new language that's simply unintelligible at face value to currently existing languages, I would imagine you could look at any case where a group of people speaking language X went on their merry way to some isolated area, and language Y developed out of that in Z number of years.  Maybe [Icelandic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Icelandic_language) could be used as an example, but probably not a very good one since it's still pretty recent, and quite similar to Old Norse.  Also it's important to consider writing vs. speaking--it's a lot easier to understand a language related to your own when it's written, harder when it's spoken, so that's going to be a variable in the mutual intelligibility of two languages, at least for a while.  Icelandic isn't mutually intelligible with most of the rest of the Nordic languages simply because they've also developed into new languages out of Old Norse.  I don't think Icelandic is old enough to actually be very far removed from Old Norse itself though (Icelandic people can read Old Norse without much trouble).

But I would guess that the only languages that are completely, absolutely unintelligible to a speaker of any other human language are language isolates.  And those are so far removed from the rest of human language that nobody can give any real answer as to their origins.

So it kind of depends on what you mean.  If you mean simply a language with clear connections to Earth languages, but is more or less mutually unintelligible with all of them, see Icelandic or maybe another language that could serve as a better example.  If you mean a language so far removed that it has no clear ties with any of the Earth's language, my guess is a really fucking long time.","1272683880"

While other provincial governments are scrambling to appease various lobby groups by adding stuff to their educational curriculums, Alberta is amending its human rights code to give parents the right to opt their children out of any discussion (not just class, but discussion) on religion, sex or sexual orientation. If teachers fail to get permission before discussing this stuff they can be fined.

I have to disagree on your take of this being a Libertarian lean on the Alberta educational system as it's a direct corruption of the separation of church &amp; state...these laws allow parents to selectively dismantle their children's curriculum by opting out of sex ed &amp; science-based education so they can supplant it with religious teaching.","1272683891"

However, now you have educated adult women who choose to follow this practice anyways, regardless of what the roots of the practice stem from.

Banning them from dressing how they have chosen to dress is simply repressing them further.

By analogy... say you were stolen as a young child from your parents, and forced into slave labor until you were a young adult. As part of being a slave, you had a large emblem branded onto your face by your slave-master.

You are now a free person, and you choose to keep the emblem on your face, as you have taken ownership of it - it is a part of your identity. However, now society makes a law that says you can't have tattoes or similar things on your face, as it is a sign of slavery, so you are forced to have this repaired against your wishes. Yay freedom!

Maybe it would be more appropriate to ban slavery, as opposed to the signs of slavery.

And I believe that, in the western world at least, we have banned slavery, as well as forms of repression against women. Women and men have (mostly) equal freedom... well, except for maybe women are banned from wearing certain types of clothing...

This law takes away a women's choice.","1272684035"

"motorcycles","t5_2qi6d","Attaboy. Don't EVER rush into a decision when it comes to second hand bikes. At this point, I'm being somewhat hypocritical, but both bikes I've owned were exactly what I was looking for after riding other peoples' bikes, so perhaps the point is moot.

As for bikes that have been dropped, like TomTheGeek said, it's pretty hard to break a frame. One possible way to tell is if the bike pulls to one side or the other. That can indicate dragging brakes, bent forks, a bent swingarm, and so on.

I bought my Concours from a gentleman that rebuilt the fairings after the first owner had a crash. I knew what to look for by going on the forums a few hours before I went to look at it, and had some notes as to possible weak points. This is an EXCELLENT way to check out a bike.

For instance: my first bike was a '93 Ninja 500, a relatively bulletproof series with few if any major faults (hell, they've been building them since ~1986) but I still checked the following, based on what I saw on the forum: does it ride straight, without pulling to the side; does it idle properly (it didn't, needed a good carb cleaning); do all lights work; are there any missing fasteners; does it burn oil; any leaks around the shifter or the mail oil gallery bolt on the (sitting on bike) right side.

Take your time, and if you find something you like, or are interested in, bring a friend, or, post the ad on here, maybe someone here has experience with that particular model. 

Also, have you got good gear? Helmet that fits properly (should be tight, but not painfully tight); good gloves, jacket and possibly overpants? What about boots?

TL;DR, enjoy the process, as you'll never forget your first bike, for better or worse.

Happy hunting!","1272684044"

Don't scrimp on the reinforcing wet concrete has a shitload of pressure behind it, thinking carefully about any services that may need to come through the wall, and using alkathene or plastic piping to leave room for it to come through the wall later on. Use plenty of steel reinforcing and pour the concrete. Once the Concrete has gone off and dried completely use either a commercially available concrete sealer that comes in rolls and sticks on, or if you're like me and want to save some cash, get a tin of tar paint and some sheets of polystyrene, make a mix of half tar paint, half water (yes its water slouble before curing) put on 3 coats of this, letting it dry between coats, then another 2 coats of full strength paint. On the last coat before it dries completely stick your polystyrene to it trying to minimise gaps or joins. Back fill the hole with gravel making sure your drainage is connected.","1272684056"

* It does a bad job of telling you why you're over a particular budget if you let budgets roll from month to month. Ideally, it would show you all of the line items that contributed to the budget. Often, it shows zero transactions because they occurred months ago.

* ""This month, you spent $100.86 on Television. This exceeds your budget of $100 by $0."" Heh.

* It uses CyberHomes to track home value. CyberHomes thinks our house is worth about 30% more than what we paid for it just a couple of months ago, contrary to the fact that the house is worth what we paid for it (by definition). Zillow has proven more accurate. You can manually enter value data, though, so it's not all bad.

* It has weird scrolling issues. Like, you'll click something somewhere, and it'll scroll to the top of the page and then refresh data. It's disconcerting, especially when connections are slow.","1272684086"

"politics","t5_2cneq","Since today's changes to the law, I'm not really against it anymore. The problem was the original wording allowed officers to require people to present identification on the basis of nothing more than the officer's suspicion. If I read the news on the recent changes, they removed that aspect.

Now they can ask for proof of identification after pulling someone over for a traffic violation or other offense. I have no problem with that. I just didn't like the idea of a police officer being able to stop someone and require they show ID just because the officer thought they might be an illegal with no evidence suggesting they are.

&gt; Would you ask the cops to specifically NOT ask people who look Hispanic to present identification? Why should people who look Hispanic be exempt from having to carry identification?

Don't use stupid tactics like this. No one is arguing that Hispanics shouldn't be stopped or required to show or carry identification any less than anyone else. I'm fine with immigrants being required to carry papers. What I was not ok with is the ability for police to stop people without any actual evidence suggesting they have done anything wrong. Just because I'm against one aspect of a bill does not mean I'm against all aspects of it.","1272684097"

"ukpolitics","t5_2qhcv","Yes, of course the argument I've put forward is pretty obvious. And
yes, I certainly did consider you might have already thought this
through, but come on - you *did* say:

&gt; None of the parties come even close to the politics I want to see in
&gt; this country. The window of their debate is so far from my positions
&gt; that it's just a joke.

And you said that immediately after ""I'm not even voting"" - which
clearly suggests you're presenting that as an *explanation* for why
you're not voting. You didn't even *attempt* to address the (obvious,
as you say) counterpoint that voting for candidate/party whose
platform you like the best is (in electoral terms, at least) exactly
the same as voting for the candidate/party whose platform you despise
the least. If you can see *any* difference between the candidates on
offer, it's intellectually dishonest of you to pretend you wouldn't
prefer one over the others (and I'd suggest it's even more intellectually
dishonest to declare that you can't see any differences at all).

So I felt obliged to *make* that obvious counterpoint as the first
part of my response, just so it'd be blatantly obvious to an onlooker
if you avoided responding to that point in a followup.

So... after that clarification :), I really am genuinely interested in
your philosophy here. I would really, honestly, like to read an
explanation of why you choose to not vote - especially one that
addresses my counterpoint covered at length above. No, I'm not trying
to trick you or set you up for a mocking response. Have a look at [my
commenting history](http://www.reddit.com/user/depleater) if you doubt
me.

----

At the risk of going way off track, I used to think that Australia's
compulsory-voting law was morally wrong, that an individual should be
absolutely free to choose whether or not they want to vote. I've since
adjusted my position a little, having read much about the way things
actually *work* in the US - where more ""reliable"" voting blocs like
the elderly have disproportionately strong influence on policy, and the
less reliable (for whatever reason) blocs such as the
late-teens/early-twenties have a disproportionately weak influence.

I eventually (reluctantly) decided I disliked the idea of certain
points of view (even (perhaps especially) if they were more likely to
be ""negative"" points of view, ie. against things rather than for
things) being under/over-represented even more than I disliked
""compulsory"" voting.  See, this is the whole
which-option-do-you-hate-least principle in action! :-)

I further justified it to myself with the knowledge that a
non-voter-on-principle (like yourself, perhaps?) could easily still
not vote... just the cost of doing so (in money or effort) would be
artificially brought closer to the cost in effort of actually voting.
So simple laziness/apathy should, statistically speaking, be much less
of a factor.

----

Finally, the reason I asked a specific question (about how you'd deal
with a ""compulsory"" voting system) was because I was genuinely
interested in getting an idea of the practicalities of your philosophy
when dealing with a system like the one I live under, one that
attempts to penalise the easy/default ""do-nothing"" state. I'd like to
find out whether you'd prefer to be fined or to deliberately vote
informal. Both could be considered a valid and principled approach,
but I'd especially like to know if you considered one more principled
than the other (and why).

The third option, not registering to vote at all (technically also a
violation of the law here in Australia, but practically unenforceable)
would suggest that you'd taken a fairly hard-line stance. So not just
""I don't want to vote in this upcoming election,"" but ""I don't want to
vote in any election ever."" That suggest it'd have to be something
**really** major to change your mind.

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt;The oil industry's activities aren't a reliable indicator of ""the public good"", and I'm not sure ""new operations raise employment and act as a stimulus"" refers to a change large enough to offset any environmental or fuel-reserve concerns.

Sure they are. When business thrives, the rest of us thrive - the people who work for them, the people who invest in them, the people who buy from them and the government that they pay taxes to and all of the people who pay taxes through them vicariously. Also, private sector stimulus is the only true stimulus. 

&gt;They will want to operate there it even if there is zero benefit for the average person at the pump, because they'll be moving more oil and making more profit than otherwise.

That doesn't really make sense. If there's no benefit for the person at the pump then that means they can't out-price the competition, meaning that the oil reserves aren't worth drilling for in the first place. That's not the case - people want to drill for them. Even if they aren't planning on drilling now, I don't have a problem with them owning the land. I'm sure they'll do better with it than the federal government ever did. 

&gt;And that's if we assume there aren't any lucrative-to-cushy aspects of whatever access deal occurs with the government. (I know I'd be concerned with it under Bush, and I don't think Obama's administration is sufficiently different that they get the benefit of the doubt here.)

I think we're kind of trapped between paradigms here. I'm from the small-government-let-whoever-drill persuasion - if this wasn't a legislative issue in the first place it would mean the government was small enough to where that this wouldn't be a legitimate concern. 

It's sad that we've come to a point in this country where political corruption is a genuine argument against private business expansion - politicians should have so little power that they aren't worth buying. 

But then I'm a dreamer....

No schools, no hospitals, no police...not even running water.  This is, in many ways, the United States.

If you give the people the schools, hospitals, etc. that they need it's still a pretty rich city, but not *as* rich.  However, everyone is extremely happy, well-educated, and healthy.

"Anarchism","t5_2qh5j","Here's how I could see Anarchism (or really any radical movement) achieving its goals peacefully:

1. Have a solid, detailed and pragmatic vision. i.e. if someone asks what are your goals, there are books you can point them to that give a pretty clear answer (and aren't - for the most part - in dispute amongst the movement). It's extremely difficult to get somewhere without having a good idea of where you want to go.

2. Begin a campaign to educate as much of the world on your movement. If your movement is truly worthwhile, eventually you'll convince a large proportion of the world, probably a majority, that change is going to be beneficial to everyone. (BTW, you could substitute ""world"" for ""country"" or ""community"" here).

3. At this point, your movement will wield enormous power. You can take many peaceful actions, such as protests, strikes, etc. and the people in charge will have to take notice. A lot of them will give up their positions peacefully. After all, a lot of the people in power aren't truly evil, the system just lets them and encourages them to act that way. (If there really are a lot of people who are truly that evil, I think Anarchism is doomed to fail anyway - fortunately I don't believe this is the case). There may be a small number who hold on as long as they can, and this is where violence may be necessary, as an absolute last resort.

You may think #2 is impossible - those in charge will run interference to the point that it's impossible to spread your message. That may be true, but I would argue that you can't possibly know that for sure. I haven't really seen the far-left complete even step #1, let alone make a genuine effort to achieve step #2.

But these steps are certainly hard. Wouldn't it just be easier to overthrow the oppressors, then worry about the rest later? Yes, it would. But as I said earlier, you'd end up with something at least as bad as what you overthrew. 

Let's say you and some friends manage to overthrow the government of your country. You then declare to the world ""You're free! We're all anarchists now!"". Of course, you have a problem - the people don't understand anarchism, and probably don't even know what it is. But worse, they fear you. It's not going to be easy to build the society you envisioned by yourself (and your small group of revolutionaries) from the top down (which is really the opposite of anarchism anyway). You're going to have to be in charge for a while, and there's a huge risk that someone in charge is going to forget ideals and start to make a grab for power. It's happened plenty of times throughout history. Not to mention, people will now want to overthrow *you*.

So I don't believe it's impossible to change the world without violence. And in fact, I think it's much easier to keep your vision in tact if you don't use violence. And if it's not impossible, violence is only a part of anarchism if you wish it to be so.

By the way, if you want an example from history of radical, non-violent change, look up Gandhi.","1272684323"

"WTF","t5_2qh61","Actually, there is some truth to this. It has been pretty well established by developmental psychologists that children who are told that they are praised for being ""hard working"" develop good work ethics whereas children who are simply told ""you are so smart"" tend to not develop those skills as well as their counterparts.

This certainly makes sense from a pure logical standpoint. Positive reinforcement that praises a child's effort should work wonders in comparison to meaningless praise for something you are born with like intelligence.

This applies to other areas also. How many little princesses do we have running around now, thanks to parents constantly telling their children ""you are prettiest and most beautiful in your whole school""?

Heck, I myself had the mindset that ""If I am smart, I don't need to work as hard as everyone else"". Rather than focusing on accomplishing what everyone else accomplishes but with less effort, properly trained kids with greater intelligence are likely to go beyond what it expected and excel in ways that the rest of their peers cannot.

If you think about it, the cost of a washer/dryer is small compared to the cost of a house.  It's hardly worth arguing about.

&gt; I need to sell this house, which is why I did not try to counter the offer with the washer/dryer on it.

I don't get it - you wanted the washer, but not enough to ask for it... huh?  If you'd signed the offer back to them with washer/dryer crossed off and no other changes, 99.9% chance they would have taken it and you'd have gotten exactly what you wanted.  NOW you just look like you're trying to renegotiate the deal in your favor, which the buyer will inherently resist.

If you can remove the microwave without damaging the house in the slightest - without pulling out any nails, without removing any screws - you are allowed to pull out plugs from electrical sockets - then it's mobile personal property, and if it isn't in the contract, you can take it with you.

In the meantime, my prediction:  No one will ever be apprehended in connection to this shooting.  The deputy in question will recover in the hospital and then go off on a long leave of absence (to deal with the trauma of course) and never be seen in the media again.  The media will continue to refer to the gun as a ""suspected AK"" because the Sheriff's office will never bother saying what the gun actually was.  And, of course, on Monday Sheriff Joe will stand up and base his entire candidacy speech on this terrible event and how it means THIS IS WAR (I'm guessing he will use that word specifically) and Arizona must elect him to stop the hordes of AK-wielding Mexicans just waiting to pour over the border.","1272684443"

I always saw Reyes as that kid at school who got caught in a vicious cycle of being victimized by bullies. If he didn't react some of those opposition players just keep pushing him. And when he did react they got a kick out of it, and kept going even more. That certainly doesn't justify the treatment he got. But it's an unfortunate fact of life.

No. They use [Wordpress Vip Hosting](http://vip.wordpress.com/). There is a link at the bottom of their website.

The problem with mediatemple is not when you get massive hits, they can handle that traffic, no doubt about it. The problem is when you don't have massive incoming hits, thats when the site slows down to a crawl. Anyways, people experience fluctuates depending on the cluster they are hosted on (some are more overcrowded than others), its just that mediatemple performance issues are pretty well known and I thought I should point that out.

Most top hosts have good customer service, the real concerns are performance and security issues. Even fast, responsive and nice customer service can't do much about consistent server issues. The best they can do is let you know really quickly that they are aware of the problem and working on it. Chances are they know it even before you asked about it, they have automated server monitor with alert system for problems like that.","1272684636"

Google using underwriters?  That was to make sure that BUYERS have the proper credit to make bids, not because Google needed someone to absorb the cost of holding unsold shares.  Google knew their shares would be bought, they didn't need a bank to guarantee a certain number sold.

Also the $135 was an inflated figure since it took into account the artificial inflation of share price often experienced in IPOs.  $85 dollars is what the market actually valued the shares at, $135 is what the bank would have sold investors if they had the chance.","1272684663"

Along the way you can walk on a glacier, see some amazing waterfalls, and hike to your hearts content.

I had a friend fly from Sydney (Australia) to get married at Moraine Lake near Lake Louise because it's one of the most beautiful places she's seen. Honestly, you can't go wrong in this area. Fly in/out of Calgary, drive an hour west to Banff and start your tour.

I'll admit I haven't spent much time east of Montreal, but being that you're American you'll have a lot easier time communicating in the west -- Quebec is largely French speaking (most understand English, many choose not to acknowledge that for whatever reason) and further east you run into some interesting accents (Sorry to the Newfies -- we love you but we can't understand a damn thing you say!)

Some things to do while you're here (assuming summer)
-Whitewater rafting on the Kicking Horse river
-Horseback tours near Panorama
-Mountain biking in Golden
-Glacier walking on the Columbia Icefield
-Canoeing near Radium
-Visit the natural hot springs in Radium, Fairmont, Banff, Ainsworth
-Ridge gliding in Radium

"Buddhism","t5_2qhnf","Just wanted to say one more thing.  Most of the proponents of the whole ""rebirth is a metaphor thing"" really have a secular/atheistic agenda that they're pushing.  It's also an almost completely western thing.

The problem here is that they have everything basically backward.  They believe so strongly in an really existing external environment, which makes externally existing bodies, which in turn make externally existing brains, which they think bring about the senses, which then bring about consciousness (somehow -- they debate about that endlessly), and because of that is a mind and suffering.  Because they're so attached to thinking everything is created from the outside inward, they can't accept the fact that when the body dies nothing continues, as they see the body as the cause of mind.

What Buddha taught was entirely the other way around.  The ignorant mind creates suffering and bodies and the external environment and so on.  The external environment as we perceive it is a result of our collective karma and mental states.  Since the appearance of a body and the external environment is caused by the mind (not the other way around); when we die we're so attached to having bodies and being in an external environment, we look for ways to make that all happen over again.

*Dude*, I am not killerstorm, whom you are quoting.

&gt;Just because 13% of total deaths in 2007 were due to cancer, it doesn't mean that in 2010 13% of total deaths will be due to cancer.

No, but it is highly suggestive. If rates are similar year-to-year (and they are), then one should expect the rate for the current year to be similar.

&gt;Toss a coin 10 times: if 9 out 10 tosses are heads, the next toss will either be heads or tails (50/50). In other words, past events have nothing to say about future events.

Past events have plenty to say about future events. Your example assumes we have predetermined the coin is fair. If I get 90% heads out of a coin, I'm going to begin to believe the coin is not fair and is biased toward heads.

If it was truly impossible to draw conclusions about the probability of future events from past statistics, actuaries wouldn't have jobs.

&gt;Again, the ratio is saying that 0.1% (yes, that's 1/10th of one percent) died of cancer in 2007 (out of the total population).

&gt;Again, 0.1% of people who died in 2007 died of cancer.

You can't even keep your own numbers straight. 0.1% of the world population died of cancer. Of the fraction of people who died, 13% died of cancer. ","1272684711"

One day, while I was on IRC, my mom sent me a message telling me my grandma had been diagnosed with cancer. We started up a sort of mailing list, and we all discussed treatment options. Eventually, we decided on a treatment plan. My family decided we would drive down there (which was a two-day drive) so that we could support her until her sister arrived.

So, during the visit, we all traveled from Grandma's house to the hospital she was staying at (about an hour away), and she had about a week of chemotherapy. I found the hospital a pretty awesome place, really, and while I was there, I had lunch with a friend I've known online for a long time. After the week of chemo, we went back to the house. There, my dad asked if I wanted to join a game of cards. I said no, and went off to have some time to myself.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","&gt;'This book is about specific arguments brought up by Jesus, Augustine, CS Lewis and Martin Luther. It's not a critique of Christians in general, or Christianity as a rational way of life.'

but it doesnt cut that way; atheism is not a body of belief like a religion. if one atheist makes an argument, for instance he states that religion has caused countless wars throughout the ages, and then you attempt to disprove that, youve not critiqued atheism at all, but rather a specific argument that a specific person made

&gt;One example: 

i scrolled down to the harris chapter and i believe i found the section you were referring to:  

""4) Factual error. Harris says that certainty about the next life 
is simply incompatible with tolerance in this one. But since Sam 
Harris is tolerated and allowed to live unmolested in a nation 
where 150 million people, by his account, possess such certainty, 
this is obviously wrong. The statement is particularly ironic given 
how he argues explicitly against tolerance for the religious faith-
ful. Given the evidence of Harris himself, it is certainty about 
the nonexistence of the next life that is incompatible with toler-
ance in this one.""

You insist repeatedly that you're a good person and you keep replying to posts like this, I think, because there's a cognitive dissonance between what you're doing and what you're saying and you keep trying to rationalize it as far as morals are concerned.

What's interesting is, I see you bouncing from, ""I'm a good person"" to ""I don't care"" so there's obviously some part of you that does want to stop because you keep trying to justify and you keep trying to convince people that you're not bad. 

You do care.

Like I said before, I don't think you're going to change because of my posts or anybody else's posts but maybe they'll eventually play a part in the cumulative effect that your conscience and the input of others have in changing your ways.

Even the best people-readers are wrong more than they'd like to admit: this includes you. I would bet that you have stolen from multiple people who couldn't afford it. Maybe they missed a meal, maybe they couldn't pay child support or fill their car up with gas because you took their money. It didn't seem like much to do, but people's interpretation of reality is often not in sync with reality.

If you *really* didn't care, I don't think you would be responding to so many posts that are either criticizing you or trying to get you to face the moral aspect of what you're doing. I don't think you're a sociopath or an evil person, but I do think that part of you recognizes that you are victimizing people and that part is not OK with it. Like I said before, good luck.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I've had a similar problem. In high school I was good at making friends and I was able to meet a lot of people through being on the football team. I had a few groups that I would hang out with. However, during my sophmore year of high school my parents divorced, my dad started going out w/ my best friend's gf, and I was prescribed Adderall for ADHD. I lost a lot of friends, I started to withdraw socially, and I simply quit talking to a girl I was starting to get involved with. I still had a group of friends I would hang out w/ but I wasn't nearly as outgoing as I used to be. I'm going to a junior college right now and it's tough to meet anyone there, I keep hearing about friends at different universities who are meeting girls and there I'm at a junior college where there is no social life.

I've got a few friends that I go out and party with now and when I first started going to parties it was tough for me to really talk to anyone. It's a weird thing being at a party with a bunch of people you don't know. What I've found is that the more times you go out, the less frightening it becomes. You start to realize that it really doesn't matter if the people you're talking to like you because the chances are that you won't talk to them again. The only progress you make happens when you quit thinking about meeting people as a goal and just have fun with it. It just becomes fun to talk to people and get to know them rather than being something you have to do. You're much more awkward when you're sitting in a corner not talking to anyone than when you make an attempt to talk to someone and fail. I actually find being at a party with a bunch of people I don't know to be better than being at a party with a bunch of people I do know. They don't know me yet, they don't have any opinions of me, i am free to make a first impression, and if I blow it i won't be talking to them again anyways. There are literally billions of people on this planet, does it really matter if one of them doesn't like you? Since you have a friend that is very social, you should ask her to introduce you to people. I have two brothers that I'll occasionally hang out with and they're always good about introducing me to friends. Generally speaking, if you're good friends with someone, you should be introducing them to other friends of yours. You don't want to rely on your friends all the time though. Your old friends probably quit hanging out with you because you were too clingy and dependent on them for your social life. Everyone has had that friend that is dependent on you for a social life and become a burden on your social life.","1272684808"

I prefer to wear safety devices when I need them.  I don't usually wear a hardhat to walk across the street, but I do when I'm walking under construction.  That's because that's when it's needed.

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt; Why the hell would the Iranian leader negotiate with Carter to free people Carter isn't holding?

Once the students took over the Embassy and seized the hostages -- creating a *huge* int'l incident -- the revolutionary gov't got involved. That's hardly surprising.

That revolutionary gov't was not interested in pleasing the ""Great Satan"" -- the US gov't who overthrew a democratic Iranian gov't in 1953 and inflicted a brutal US-backed dictator on the Iranian people.

The revolutionary gov't was interested in preserving itself and in defending Iran from a US-backed Iraqi invasion.

Once the revolutionary Iranian gov't got involved, of course they sought to use the situation to their own advantage. They needed US spare parts and especially TOW anti-tank missiles. So the Iranian gov't started secret negotiations with the Carter administration to cut a deal to free the hostages.

Unfortunately for Carter -- who hoped for an ""October Surprise"", the releasing of the hostages before the Nov. election -- the Iranians were also negotiating with the traitor Ronald Reagan's election team to keep the hostages imprisoned until after Reagan took office.

Reagan offered the better deal so the Iranians took Reagan's deal and not Carter's. (A small part of this traitorous affair would come out as the ""Iran-Contra"" scandal in Reagan's 2nd term.)

&gt; You're admitting that it was the Iranian government that held diplomats hostage on their embassy grounds.

Yes, once the revolutionary Iranian gov't took over the embassy situation, they, not surprisingly, used it to their own country's advantage.

&gt; This is the equivalent of an invasion of foreign territory and a casus belli.

Wow -- a casus belli! :-) You speak Latin. Color me not impressed.

So when the US overthrew the democratically-elected Iranian gov't and installed a puppet dictator, was that a ""casus belli""?

When the US encouraged Saddam Hussein to launch an invasion of Iran, was that a ""casus belli""?

The US gov't has committed many acts of war and atrocities against the Iranian people. There are many good and valid reasons Iranians call the US gov't ""the Great Satan.""

&gt; Which means that Chomsky is full of shit.

No, it doesn't. Chomsky's point -- read the headline -- was that Iran has not launched invasions and foreign wars. He is exactly correct.","1272684845"

The problem was that this was literally days after the stolen device was returned.  There is literally no legal reason for the raid, since the actual stolen property had been returned as requested by the several billion dollar company.  At this point, Chen and Gizmodo are considering suing the San Mateo PD, and have a good case for it.  *Apple should not have reported their property stolen DAYS after it had been returned to them*.

Apple didn't put a gun to the SMPD's head, but they did report their property stolen after said property had in fact been returned to Apple's possesion.  Therefore, they are in fact partly responsible for the raid.","1272684865"

Ironically, a function that finds out if it will halt or not and does exactly that is also undecidable.

As more and more people become unfit to server, we'll need to have more F22's, Predators, and high-cost military systems. Arguably, it'd be better to not spend so much on the super-high tech weapons systems, and just have the fallback of, ""Well, we can deploy 5 million capable soldier's at a moment's notice""; that's what people cite as the root of China's military might.

and

&gt; For nearly 20 years, there has been a debate among social scientists on the extent and potential impact of negative peer sanctions often referred to as ‘acting white.’ he consensus gentium is: (1) ‘acting white’ does not exist in nationally representative samples, and (2) to the extent that it is discernible in data, it is concentrated in low-income minority schools. This paper demonstrates that the facts point in the exact opposite direction: ‘acting white’ is observable in nationally representative data, but non-existent in predominantly black schools. There is, however, a crucial point of agreement. We, like Ferguson (2001), Cook and Ludwig (1997), and Ainsworth-Darnell and Downey (1998), find no empirical support for the oppositional culture hypothesis described in Fordham and Ogbu (1986).

"funny","t5_2qh33","This thread was a circle-jerk of positive homosexual vibes (which is fine) and my dose of harsh reality - that the person in this picture will have to spend much more time worrying about contracting AIDS than the guy who bemoaned the fact that he wasn't gay - was not well received by the Reddit hivemind. 

The overly dismissive and simplistic post to which I responded (Chriss62) disingenuously tried to counter this reality with the argument that **everyone** has to worry about AIDS, therefore it's offensive to single out one group. The obvious implication of this argument is that both sexes spend the same amount of time worrying about AIDS, so shut up.

Here's why that argument is wrong, and all posts stand. Quite simply, it pretends that the mere possibility of a risk happening weighs the same on people's mind - and presents the same danger of infection - irrespective of one's individual circumstances.

For example, if it simply is possible for two people to be struck by lightening, but one person has a .01% chance of this happening while a second person has a 60% chance, obviously the second person will spend a lot of time worrying about this occurrence. The whole contracting HIV example illustrates this even more, as prevention is partially within one's control, though the percentages aren't quite this far apart.

EDIT: I can see your argument about my original post, and I agree I should have rephrased it to say the guy in the picture has a dramatically higher chance of contracting HIV/AIDS than the poster I responded to. However, I don't think many would have picked up on this nuance, and the negative response would have been the same. 

The argument stands because homosexuals have far more to worry about contracting AIDS, simply because the percentage of eligible sexual partners infected is far higher than the percentage of eligible heterosexual partners.","1272685156"

This episode actually had some tension to it, and I was still expecting a last minute reset to status quo. Not sure how long it will last before everyone is back together, probably only an episode or two, but glad to see the increase in quality.

One of the problems on a show like this, is that it is difficult to really put people in believable jeopardy since they can't kill off too many people when there are so few people onboard to fill roles before you run out. BSG had a population of 40K people, so crew could be killed and the lack of trained crew as they died actually became part of the plot.","1272685182"

"relationship_advice","t5_2r0cn","To be honest, I’m surprised that all of the posts thus far are so supportive of your position.  You asked for help, and people are just pointing out how your girlfriend has done something wrong, and how you don’t need any fixing or advice.  While there may or may not be an issue with both of you, you are the one stepping up and asking for advice, which is good – but if no one offers advice, what is the use?  Sure, you may be fine already, but people should always be on the lookout for opportunities to improve themselves.

In your case, reading through the post, I started imagining things I would say or do.  I’m not saying I’m a certified pro at communicating, but I don’t think I have any issues.  In doing so, I noticed a few places where my response would have differed greatly:

When she mentioned violence – Was she hurt?  Is everyone ok?  What happened?  (Doesn’t violence sound at least a little interesting?)

The movie – Sure, it may have been inconvenient, but she wanted to go see movie A.  Whoever said serious relationships are convenient?  She’s willing to take the time out, and so should you.  Ok, let’s say it’s incredibly inconvenient for both of you.  At least don’t tell her that movie B sucks, let her decide on her own!  Besides, you haven’t even seen it yourself.  Seeing a movie two nights in a row doesn’t sound that bad to me, but think back to maybe when you first started dating her… would you ask her to go to a movie two nights/dates in a row?  That’s kind of monotonous.

Ok, the rest of the post I think can be sorted by improving your communication skills.  The key point - and understand, this is truly the only thing you need to be a really good conversationalist – is that you need to have GENUINE INTEREST.  What does that mean?  It means not thinking of what you’re going to say next, it means not just thinking about how YOU feel – you said it yourself: “Usually I just ramble on about my own feelings, or give excuses for my behaviour, instead of just being quiet and listening to her.”  Why not ask how she feels about something?  That’s a pretty open ended question right there.

Situation – you’re talking to people and you don’t really find them all that interesting.  It’s fair, some people are just boring.  What do you do?  How do you make yourself interested in this boring person?  Just fake it until you make it.  You’ll find that after a while, the interest becomes a habit, until you really are interested in what people have to say.

I agree that on certain points she is wrong.  But she is not here asking for help – so I offer you this post in the hopes that by improving yourself, she will also change for the better.","1272685186"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","By saying ""comfortably"" I think you wrong most people who work in the field of animal testing.

I'm sure there are some people who don't care.  I'm also sure there are some people who DO care.  I'm also sure that because of people with beliefs as strong as yours there are controls and monitoring to make sure that we DON'T do these kinds of things unreasonably.

I also do not believe that eliminating this kind of testing would speed up those ""major breakthroughs"" that you believe are close.  In fact I believe it would slow it down.  (eg: I come up with a model for simulation of the human ear.  I can verify that simulation by: testing it on animals with a similar ear or doing LONG term studies of humans)

And I also believe that until we HAVE those models, if there is a situation where humanity would be helped by killing some animals, I hope they kill the animals in whatever methods and quantities are needed.

"offbeat","t5_2qh11","Playing devil's advocate here...

We all accept evolution and natural selection. From a Slate article on intelligence and race, ""In a hunter-gatherer society, IQ will still be important, but if a hunter cannot shoot straight, IQ will not bring food to the table,"" argues psychologist Robert Sternberg. ""In a warrior society … physical prowess may be equally necessary to stay alive."" It's a good point, but it bolsters the case for a genetic theory. Nature isn't stupid. If Africans, Asians, and Europeans evolved different genes, the reason is that their respective genes were suited to their respective environments.

http://www.slate.com/id/2178122/


What's more, in fruit flies, the clearly demonstrated the genetic link to intelligence, and found that in different situations,  selection would occur *against* intelligence. In survival situations, the flies with higher intelligence were outcompeted by their dumber bethren.

http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2005/12/fruit_flies_and.html

So why are we so certain that in different populations of humans that natural selection acted in the exact same way? Our physical differences alone should demonstrate that the selective forces have had time to act, and have acted differently across all races.","1272685189"

The bullets keep their heads down. The grenade launchers kill them (I'm so glad I had one). If that didn't do it, the artillery fire that lands 3 minutes later does the trick.

A note on ineffective suppressive fire: We don't always do battle damage assessments as the soldiers on the ground, but eventually UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) and/or helicopters come by and we usually get the word on the number of enemies dead. Typically we killed more than we expected.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","From the pieced together memories of others (none my own): I spoke in tongues, got into a fist fight with a girl, and went missing for an hour with a girl referred to as ""Skeletor"" (creepy skinny/bony chick).

The tongues and and fist fight was with the same girl. I apparently was trying to tell her something, but it was coming out all garbled and creepy, she got freaked out and punched me twice (jaw/eye), and apparently I hit her back once (jaw). I was told I was a jerk even though she was not bruised, and I had a black eye and my jaw was slightly off alignment.

The Skeletor chick was before that. The last thing I remember was talking to this girl as she described her first experience with anal sex was in the back of a car, and I said something along the lines of ""in a very uncomfortable place"". That was the last line I remember and where I was told I left for an hour somewhere with the girl and assume I was raped.

Edit:
I remembered another story of mine.

When I was a senior in high school, well this was after I graduated. I had some friends from a different school who's graduation I went to and I went out with them afterward. They were supposed to have a place to hang out and we were gonna drink but the hostess bailed and I happened to be house sitting for my friend that weekend. I ran home and grabbed a couple jugs of vodka (reeeeaaallllllyyyy cheap) and basically it was me and some people in this house drinking.

At the time I was interested in one of the girls, but she was still on the fence about her ex. He ended up wanting to come over too, so I announced to the party that i was ""going to drink till I can't feel feelings"". I woke up the next morning in my boxers, dick hanging out, and the girl I was trying to date sitting next to me taking care of me.

The whole night I started chugging a whole jug of vodka, walking around and threw up in various corners of the house. At one point I fell into a previously vomited on corner which in my stupor seemed like a good reason to undress. I then went to another corner, saw the vomit, and fell in it. That's when I became the guy that needed to be taken care of.

Because my friends weren't familiar with the neighborhood they didn't know how to get back home, so I had to give directions as best I could, followed by a call to my aunt to come help me clean up the house before my friends family came back home. It was cleaned, I slept for two days to break the hangover, and it took a few months before the teasing from my friends stopped.

""I thought the puke exactly underneath the couch, without actually getting the couch itself was pretty cool. Then I saw the one on the ceiling in the dining room, bravo!"" - My Aunt","1272685282"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Well, I certainly applaud anyone wanting to make a hundred meta comments, but take it from this old forum rat, I've spent my entire adult life on forums, and a program like this one can do more harm than good.

If you only make one type of comment (and that's all a single post like meta comments are going to do for you), you're setting yourself up for injuries down the road. I've seen it a hundred times.

It's like putting a powerful engine in a stock Toyota Tercel. What will you accomplish? You'll blow out the drive train, the clutch, the transmission, etc., because those factory parts aren't designed to handle the power of an engine much more powerful than the factory installed engine.

meta comments basically only stop memes for a short while and to some extent, can be amusing. What you really want to do is train your entire online identity, all the major comment groups (memes, meta comments, simple lols, fanboy rage, and sometimes even insightful comments) at the same time, over the course of a visit to a forum. And don't forget your trolling!

I'm proud of you guys wanting to do this. Three cheers! Falling in love with posting on forums, trolling fools, etc., is one of the greatest things you can do for yourself. And you WILL fall in love with it if you can just force yourself to stick with it a year or two and experience the amazing progress you'll make.

But do it right, okay?

My advice, find a good forum, with qualified admins who will design your filters for you (especially in the beginning, until you get the hang of it yourself) and guide you in your quest for internet fame. Thirty to 45 minutes a day, three days a week, is all you'll ever need to do (I refuse to believe anyone is so busy that he or she cannot make time for that, especially considering how important it is).

And don't worry about being embarrassed or being a n00b the first time you visit a forum. You have to start somewhere and almost every one of us were there ourselves at one time. So no one will say anything to you and very, very quickly you will progress way beyond that stage anyway.

Now get out there and do it! :-)","1272685293"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","""What's the best way to monetize my writing skills""

Not sure if this is your cup of tea, but you could become a lawyer. A lot of lawyers (think: the types who don't walk into courtrooms) are basically highly-paid professional writers. If you go to a good law school (think top 14), you can START at $160k.

You could also go to grad school for an MFA in writing and try to become a college professor, all the while doing writing on the side.

I give you these alternatives because it is very hard to just BE a writer (unless you're doing journalistic writing, but given the state of THAT industry, that isn't easy either). Me personally, I'm going to law school and am working on my novel right now. If I win the lottery (i.e. if I can get a publishing deal), I can be a writer as a full time profession; if not, it can always be a favorite pasttime.","1272685308"

"web_design","t5_2qh1m","&gt;I'm not sure about the ""very little"" part; Youtube now encodes in h264, and it is the default when you open up Flash video encoder.

Youtube is available as an App on the iPhone... and the experience is far greater than attempting to use a web app. You cannot deny that.

&gt;It does in 10.1, on all platforms.

Do you want to get into this? I'd love to. 10.1 runs like _fucking shit_ on Macs. You know to tell when people run anything Flash based on a Mac? When their fans engage FULL SPEED. Because it's so terrible on that platform that the computer must engage the fans to maximum. Mind you, the computers handle 720p h.264 just fine-- but a little shitty 380p youtube video? Processor = raped. 

And let's not even GET INTO how flash has run on linux for the past decade.

It's Windows performance has been _tolerable_, but still ridiculously less decent than native performance. A 2D game, running sprites with keyboard controls, runs a FAR LOWER frame per second that Crysis cranked up to high quality on my computer.

I'm really not interested in debating this. The video on flash sucks, unless it uses straight h.264... in which case Flash is nothing more than a UI ontop of real technology, which is fine.

Flash for games, sucks universally. It just does. It sucks. There is no argument here. Flash has never produced a game that runs well in comparison to natively coded programs.

On a computer... we don't care. On a mobile platform... this changes everything. I do not want Flash on the iPhone. I don't even want it as an option. It will only make the experience worse for everyone involved. There is _nothing good_ to come from allowing Flash on the iPhone. None. ","1272685390"

"linux","t5_2qh1a","&gt; Deleting sda3 &amp; sda4 would be perfect, because I would need 2 partitions at least for ubuntu-- one for the filesystem, including home, and one for swap.

You don't *need* a swap partition; you can use swap-files instead.  But that being said, you could easily set all of that inside of a logical volume (extended partition). Grub *does* work from within an extended partition, so... no problems there.

This would then let you set up a second primary partition as EXT3, load up an ext3-compatible Windows driver, and use that partition as shared space within both drives.

For added points, you can start using Universal Extractor to pull all your new apps for the Windows partition into the secondary partition as ""Portable"" apps (or just use genuinely portable apps in the first place) -- as well as dumping your computer game CDs into folders in the partition from the Ubuntu side so they are directly runnable on the Windows side w/o the CD (you'll need, usually, NoCD cracks to do this).

This has the added benefit of being ""registry-free"".  And to wrap it all up, you symlink your WINE install's C:\ directory to the partition and run everything in it on either side by and large regardless of the OS you're running.

Finally, if you're feeling **truly** adventurous, you can set up VirtualBox to pull read that partition *as well as the original Windows partition*, for a Windows install.

I suppose I was thinking that if you saw someone of a given ethnicity, how you would automatically determine their nationality based upon that.  Say you saw someone that's ethnically Mongol, I don't see how you would be able to conclude whether that person has Chinese or Mongolian nationality, both having a relatively large population of ethnic Mongols.  Or if you saw someone ethnically Han, they could quite easily be Indonesian by nationality.  I just don't really see the immediate connection between someone's appearance and their nationality, although of course there are correlations.

So while I get that there's a strong correlation between Chinese nationality and Han ethnicity, it seems to disregard the migration that's taken place both to and from China.  It seems overly simplistic to equate Han ethnicity with China and vice versa.","1272685500"

"unitedkingdom","t5_2qhqb","This isn't too unusual, or unprecedented. But it's still a fairly significant sign for this election cycle. Especially given how crazy it has been.

Their comments about Labour's half-hearted (and sporadic) endorsements of electoral reform are interesting. I expect Labour will get more behind that idea over the next few years, because Blair's actions when he was PM have (along with many other factors) have  helped erode their voter base to a critical degree, by making them less capable of winning a majority.

Labour was always strong in Scotland and Wales. And in fact, traditionally depended heavily on Scottish and Welsh seats to get them into power. But when Blair gave more authority to those nations, it invigorated their local nationalist parties, which tangibly eroded Labour support. I think his steering of the party more to the right was a conscious attempt to offset that loss (along with other reasons). By moving Labour (or ""New Labour"") over, the idea was to win over some of the moderate/independent English voters.

But it hasn't worked; partly because the LibDems have picked up more of those votes (disaffected liberal voters) than Blair or other party leaders expected; partly because the decline in trade unions hasn't abated; and partly because he's now competing more directly with the Tories, but without the benefit of tradition and hereditary voting patterns.

It'll be really interesting to see where Labour head after this election. It sounds like hyperbole, but the next year or two will likely determine if the party survives in the long-run.

"reddit.com","t5_6","Re the use of the comma, I agree, but then I would have had to use semi-colons to separate the other items in the list so that the comma wouldn't seem to be denoting two items, but two aspects of one item.  I could have done it by proper grammatical rules, but I was aiming mostly for the casual reader who wouldn't necessarily analyse things at that detailed a level.  Since you replied I can explain myself, so exact punctuation doesn't turn out to have been critical between you and me.

I also love his interviews.  I'm not sure if I'd rate them above his fiction for stylistic innovation, but for a straight read, to have entertainment value front and centre, I totally agree.  Bill was -- and this is often overlooked -- a class A entertainer.  His interviews make me laugh out loud (literally, not lol) more than Lenny Bruce's standup does.  

His conspiracy stuff -- that is an interesting topic.  I find it endlessly entertaining, but I can never be sure exactly when he is serious and when he isn't.  I mean, his initial credulity with Scientology, then his later disaffection with it... it can be hard to know where in all of that to find his incisive truth-telling and where he is just rattling the bars of our cage.  And I suspect that he purposely doesn't make it easy.

Nice to meet you, anyway -- someone who has at least thought about this stuff.  In the 80s I saw Bill in Toronto and everyone who was anyone was there (not that I was anyone... I was just a schmuck with a ticket that seemed to me to explode but that meant nothing to anyone else).  These days it's Bill Who?  Not that I'm clinging to the past; I'm just confused by the rapid change from supposedly being culturally fundamental to being culturally irrelevant.  He either was never the former or people have rushed to the latter without thinking about it.  

Anyway, I've kind of missed him lately, so when I noticed it was my Reddit birthday I decided to post this.  Hope you've enjoyed the moment.  I certainly have.  Feel free to continue the conversation or let it go, as you please.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I'm in college working to get a degree in Law Enforcement and I just took a class on rape, domestic violence, etc. I learned that if you don't ask you partner 'Can we have sex?' and he/she/it doesn't say 'yes.' it will be considered rape in court.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","**A patent is a 20k document that gives you the right to spend $2.5-7.5M in an infringement suit to stop someone else from practicing your invention.** unless you have that sort of money, you should not bother. if you do, **get a lawyer**. this is **not** something you can do yourself.

if you do have a great idea **then make it and start marketing it**. patents are for big entrenched players, and it is a total waste of money and time for any startup. **make your technology, get it out to market, see how consumers respond to it, iterate, re-release, and continue that cycle.** patents are not a path to innovation, they are a way to protect an established company. 

also **you cannot patent ideas**. unless you have actually reduced the idea to practice, you cannot patent it.

honestly, just go for trying to make it and market it. if someone else winds up ""stealing"" your idea, it probably means they are better at business. good ideas ≠ good business. a good idea is only a fraction of what it takes to run a good business.

Atheists are united by their lack of belief in god - if you attack the most popular arguments for not believing in god, then you're attacking the majority of atheists, too. And the authors listed happen to present the most popular arguments for not believing in god, so...

&gt;Harris says that certainty about the next life is simply incompatible with tolerance in this one. But since Sam Harris is tolerated and allowed to live unmolested in a nation where 150 million people, by his account, possess such certainty, this is obviously wrong.

I remembered it as 'morality' and not 'tolerance.' But that doesn't change my objection. Harris is speaking in terms of philosophy - he's saying that if you crunch the numbers, you end up with errors. Day is speaking in practical terms - you say that belief in an afterlife is incompatible with tolerance, and yet here we are surrounded by tolerant afterlife-believers.

Here's an analogous conversation:

A: Materialism is incompatible with dualism.

B: And yet here we are surrounded by people who believe in materialism and dualism. What now?

The fact that people can hold two contradictory beliefs at once isn't evidence of the philosophical compatibility of those ideas.

Hey don't dis fiddles and fire...  But seriously, I think anyone who has entered into a meaningful relationship with the natural world can see the need to preserve it.  Many people, myself included, have been divorced and/or abstracted from the very needs for human survival all of our lives. 

For example: I turn on the tap to get water, I go the the grocery store to get food.  I use the ATM to pay for these things.  All of these actions are far removed from the natural world.  They are based on the system we live in.

So can we all base our future existence on rivers and naturally occurring food sources? No. No, but we can work towards that goal.

I see answers are dangerous at this point.  

Work towards something that is logical, work towards something that is obtainable.  Work, and encourage other to do the same.  Anything else is jacking off.

It's indisputable that tobacco was a major driving force in the development of the United States economy, as it was used as a commodity of exchange and supplied Europe's growing demand for the crop. As fewer men and women agreed to indenture themselves in return for passage to America, the only viable solution in Colonial America to keep a steady, economically sustainable supply of workers was to resort to slavery.

Depending on how old and how many nuts they've had, you probably didn't do any hardcore damage. It's not something instantly poisonous (like I think avocados are to them) but it is toxic long term. Rhere's actually a lot of really bad food and toys that pet stores market for chinchillas, even though their not, such as strings and toys with unshelled nuts, food that has sunflower seeds and colored bits in it. Sometimes it catches me off guard too, it can be confusing especially when things are geared for ""small animal.""

optipest also mentioned ""minus the dried fruit."" It's true too, they can't really digest sugar either. However, a small amount of it, like a raisin or half a raisin on a rare occasion (once a week or something) can be acceptable, but you have to watch for diarrhea.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","This disconnect goes far beyond race to the point of almost being tribal.  I once had a hilarious encounter in Germany with two friends, leaving behind in our wake totally befuddled Germans.  

To start with, I look German, and though I speak almost no German, my Schwabian-German accent is perfect, and I was wearing European cut clothing.  So you can imagine the raised eyebrows when I blurted out a well practiced pet phrase, to the effect of, ""Pardon me, but I don't understand German very well"", just as someone would have said who lived in that area their whole life.

One of the gentlemen with me was a very dark American black man, with very stereotypical negroid features.  Quite brilliant really, a computer expert before it was fashionable.  He spoke German fluently, but with the heavy upper class French accent of his French German language teacher.  But he could have easily read and discussed Goethe in German, while sounding like a Parisian snob.

This left the Germans perplexed, to say the least.  To the point of demanding that we explain ourselves.  This was done by the third gentleman in our group, who was a professor of German history and language, spoke German in four accents, and had been given an award by the German government for improving US-German relations.

In the twangiest East Texas drawl I have ever heard, peppered with ""shucks"" and ""golly gee whiz"", and other Americanisms, he made a bumbling display of ignorance about everything and anything German.  While we gawked at him with open mouthed amazement.

But this utterly satisfied the Germans.  They now knew that we were all American, and Americans are odd.  So order was restored to their universe.

The professor later explained that southern and cowboy accents and twang for some reason have a very soothing effect on the German ear, and on hearing it, Germans tend to become relaxed, calm and helpful.  Which had saved his bacon several times in the past.","1272685862"

Yes it works out that you contribute to society, but getting an education and working hard aren't what keep the elites propped up. On the contrary, it's people's apathy from entertainment, being distracted by petty bickering, and not having an education that leads to people never questioning the elites. If you'll notice, the elites have educations and work hard as well. They have many differences though. They have connections, social skills, mainstream interests and activities. Anyways, there are many reasons rich stay rich and middle class stay middle class and a lot I haven't covered, but getting an education and working hard are not part of it.

I think a lot of people are just spiteful that they can't do whatever they want and that getting any degree doesn't necessarily guarantee a job so they take out their frustrations on the natural scape goat of ""the elites"" I'm not part of the elite, but I do know that education can only help your level of success.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","&gt; Are your kids going to inherit enough money to support them through life?

Currently each child has 2 million in trusts.  They can use the money when they graduate from high school for college and some limited living expenses afterward but won't really have free access to that money until they are 30.  There is also other money that they will more than likely inherit but for now the trusts are all that is really ""theirs"".  They don't know about them.

&gt; If so, and I'm assuming this was your situation as well, how would you like them live their lives? 

I would like them all to go to college and maybe graduate school. I would like them all to have jobs or at least do something that is meaningful to them.

&gt; What is the most expensive thing you've paid for with your own earned money? 

Since I've never really had a job, nothing.

&gt; With your family's money? 
 
My home (about $600,000 6 years ago)

&gt; As you are divorced, what are you looking for in a partner? As you are a woman with money you don't particularly need a wealthy husband, so what other qualities?

Probably the same things any other person looks for in a partner - kindness, humor, some sort of physical attraction.  I would prefer they had a career rather than just live off family money - it tends to make a person rather dull.

&gt; Is there a vacation spot you go that has other people with the same kind of money?

LOL - Like a old-money convention?  No - we just go on normal vacations.  Usually Hawaii or some tropical spot in the summer with my parents and sister and skiing in the winter.

&gt; What kind of friends did you generally have in school? Other rich kids? Outcasts? How was your school experience in general? Private school? 

I went to a fairly exclusive all-girls private school so most of my friends were either wealthy or their parents sacrificed a lot to have them go there. I live in the same city I grew up in and am still very good friends with many of these same girls.","1272686031"

"badcompany2","t5_2rgyt","The most important thing is capturing the m-com. 

In my experience getting in close, arming, laying a smoke-screen and tackling disarmers at close range is a far more effective tactic than arming, dying or running away, then letting snipers pick off any potential disarmers from a distance.

Most shooters seem to attract people who think they are ace snipers, but 90% of them just aren't as good as they think they are. Often, I can get more distance kills in a much shorter time than them by just using an assault rifle. Even on teams where there are four or five snipers, they still can't pick off the disarmers fast enough to prevent a disarm.

I'd say ignore the whiners - if they want to contribute to the team, they should be in close with the assaults throwing motion sensors or stay distant but be mortaring the armed m-com or sniping/spotting people outside of the smokescreen who are heading into it. They shouldn't be moaning about the lack of easy, static targets (ie disarmers) that you've denied them. ","1272686059"

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","&gt; From the Guardian 2006: The number of children born in Germany last year was the lowest since the end of the second world war, the Federal Statistical Office reported yesterday. According to provisional figures, 680,000 babies were born in 2005, down from 1.36 million in 1964. Leading economists said unless Germans started breeding again Europe's biggest nation faced the prospect of reduced growth, economic decline and an elderly shrinking population.

And here is a [link](http://seekingalpha.com/article/186588-greek-demographics-suggest-stagnant-future-economic-growth) to an analysis for Greece that says the declining population growth will not be able to pay for the massive entitlements granted to the aging population. This is the picture of the future of the US and the EU. The only solution is to stop the entitlement train and get as many cars off of the track as we can before it happens. But NO - we are adding the entitlements and screwing the poor pooch to death.

Thanks for playing though.

Fire and Police: Police and Fire are basic services that apply equally to all citizens. This is an entitlement that is necessary and one I support. You assume that these services can only be provided by progressive income taxation. That is just not true. Many Fire services are voluntary in rural areas. The best case would be this: a town of 10,000 has a police department that costs a million dollars a year. Every citizen would get a bill for $100 dollars a year. A family of four would pay $400. This way a population would know what they are paying for and if crime is a problem they know they will have to pay more to fix it. It is completely transparent.","1272686202"

Your monthly payments are the exact same every month, there's no fluctuation, it's always the same, and therefore they deem monthly statements a waste. Also, you have the option to make your payments more frequently, not everyone pays monthly (although monthly is the maximum allotted time in between payments due to interest accruing) and the idea of weekly or biweekly statements is just nuts.

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","Your claims are again full of fallacy.

Murder is an initiation of force you stupid ignorant shit for brains.

You can't use murder as an analogy because the act of murder itself is an initiation of force against the person who you are interacting with.

The murderer can't claim that because he murders with the expectation that third parties will not interfere with him, that murder is therefore a right.  You are forgetting the person getting murdered.

The argument of rights is between any TWO people, where interactions take place.  It is not between one person, an ignored second person, and a third person, where the relevant area of focus is the first and third person.

You just completely ignored the person getting murdered as if *his* expectations and *his* rights are not important.

With speech, it is completely different.  If you make an argument, then you expect *the person to whom you are making the argument* is not going to use force against you to prevent you from making the argument.

If you want to use murder instead of speech to understand this a little more, then the proper method is not to add the expectations of a third party, but to stay in the two person world.

So, the analogy would be of this form (I substituted ""murder"" where there was ""free speech"" before, and ""kill"" where there was ""making an argument"" before:

I hold that the right to [murder] exists.  I hold this because the fact that I do [kill] someone else, it is only because I expect them to not use force against me in order to prevent me from [murdering them].

Now, I hope that your extremely primitive brain can at least grasp the fact that this argument makes no sense.  If you expect your victim to not use force to prevent you from murdering them, which is another way of saying if you expect your victim not to fight back or defend themselves (which is another way of saying using physical means to stop you) if they know that you are going to kill them, then this is NOT murder.  This is voluntary, assisted suicide.

This is why you CAN'T use murder as an analogy for my argument regarding the right to free speech.  If you use the same argument, it is contradictory.

You fucking retard.  Go fuck yourself and stop trolling me.  And go fuck yourself for actually believing that you have the ability to ""illuminate"" my readers.  They can think for themselves.

"malefashionadvice","t5_2r65t","As for a good quality (but slightly more expensive shirt), I recommend Forsyths of Canada.  I picked up one of their 80s-2ply white dress shirts a while back, and it's one of my go-to dress shirts.  I've seen this brand at some higher end men's stores, but also at some mall places.  These shirts might run $40-$60 per shirt, but it's well worth the price quality wise.  

Banana Republic also makes good shirts.  Check out your area for a B.R. outlet mall as you can find some good deals on quality B.R. shirts there sometimes.  

To add to the above, I also highly recommend getting your shirts tailored.  The majority of shirts you'll find tend to ""tent out"" when you're wearing them unbuttoned (i.e. they are cut to allow for a wide variety of body sizes, and billow out when untucked), and IMHO this looks freakin' retarded.  Pick up a cheap Arrow or Merona, and then having it tailored to your body type will make it looks miles better on you (both tucked and untucked).  Tailoring usually runs 10-20 depending on the place, but it will be well worth it.  ","1272686274"

No.

All the trainers I have encountered have been bosu ball loving pseudo-science spewing mouthbreathers with nice teeth. They are going to get you doing stupid unnecessary and not optimally effective exercises and you'll see little result and be more inclined to quit.

I know its an easy thing to champion around here, but if you do the large compound exercises you'll get in and out in half the time relative with a trainer and assuming you have a good diet, you'll see results.

A much better method would be to do something simple, like starting strength, or strong lifts, and post videos of your form here for critiques, or find a gym buddy who knows there stuff.


Think up a couple more and go from there. Really though there are a million youtubes out there (best example I can link: http://www.youtube.com/user/timdonahey ) that have great form you can watch and imitate .

If you really want to go the trainer route, quiz them to make sure they aren't retarded. Questions like, 

""What is a downside of ab workouts"" 

Answer: some variant on shear stress especially on the lumbar spine 

and others that show they can talk to you not just to tell you when you're doing something wrong, but why its not a very good idea. Make sure they are knowledgeable on the big lifts (squats, deads, bench, press, row) and maybe do a months worth.

The incredible irony there is that Burroughs was really well before his time in understanding how much power various mediums have (he thought the age of the novel was long since passed when he was writing his most important works, and he was trying to figure out some new medium between writing, painting, etc.)  As an aside, I think this is why so much of Burroughs spoken-word pieces have so much gravity.  He was trying to be as much an artist in that medium as he could be, having recognized that perhaps the day of the written word was coming to and end, and he was trying to become relevant in a new art form.

He commented a lot about the power of television, personality, etc. and the very short attention span of most of the viewership (he constantly dismissed the middle class as very stupid -- his view was that the poor actually payed a lot more attention to shit).  He more or less understood that having people ""famous for being famous"" was right around the corner, and he knew how fickle a mass audience could be.  There is little distance or time between ""love him"" and ""hate him"", ""fundamental"" and ""irrelevant"", and he fully understood that.

Drama: The Wire, Dexter, Breaking Bad, Band of Brothers, The Pacific, Spartacus: Blood and Sand (godawful pilot, gets pretty fun though so give it a few more eps), Deadwood, Firefly

Comedy: It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, Party Down, Arrested Development, The Life and Times of Tim, South Park, Weeds (you can stop watching after season 2 or 3), Da Ali G Show, Curb Your Enthusiasm, Freaks and Geeks (and if you like that, Undeclared)

Science/docu/etc: Mythbusters, Survivorman, there are lots of good nature docus from BBC, some of the most recent and well known are Planet Earth, The Blue Planet, Life. Make sure you get the BBC versions (narrated by David Attenborough) and I recommend HD!","1272686362"

This study is specifically targeting factory workers. They are not studying average daily levels of noise or even a dynamic range of noise. They are studying factory noise, which you guessed it, is loud noise.

Here's a raging clue. When you think something is too loud, it probably is. Again, when there are studies aplenty clearly describing the positive correlation between decibles and compromised auditory efficiency, soft science like this seems like utter wastefulness of them dang ol' fecking NIH funds.

Here, I'll dumb it down even further: touching your arm hair constantly will eventually cause you to no longer feel the sensation the same way. Ta dah: habituation and desensitization to recurring stimuli. The auditory system, specifically the ""hair"" cells fundamentally work in the same way.

If you think I'm suggesting you wear earplugs all the time, then you're a Silly. If you want to walk around the street with a hard hat, make sure you have a cop, chief, sailor, cowboy, and biker dude with you otherwise you'll be *that* weird guy.

If you need a researcher telling you that constant exposure to cacophonous noise adversely a(e?)ffects your hearing ability, then you're silly. Ever been out to a party or a bar/lounge/etc. with loud music? Notice how when you leave you can't hear very well at all?

Second, splitting up with her is the right thing to do.  Give up on the prospect of a relationship with her for now; don't even think about it.

Third, I really don't know as much as I'd like to about this subject, and if someone else knows more about it take their advice over mine, but I wouldn't be comfortable leaving her with the baby.  She's emotionally abusive, threatening to be physically abusive, and by the sound of her it seems quite likely that she's in at least some ways negligent as a parent.  I don't know if she wants to be living with the child or not, and if you do or not, but you need to get her away from her mother; it's not safe.  Again, someone who knows more about how this works should jump in here, but my sense is that you need to sit down with her, have a serious talk about the child, and if she's not willing to give her up, you should consider more drastic measures (i.e. child protective services).

I parked in the ghetto because the van was not registered or insured and I didn't want to deal with cops.  My friends called it the ""kidnapper van"" because it had bullet holes in it, a broken windshield, and a piece of plywood on one of the side-door windows.  It also had no gauges or a heater, just large holes in the dash where these should be.  Only the drivers-side window was functional, so it got very hot in there by about 8am in the summer.  Winter was a bitch too, all I had for heat was candles.  But I kept it reasonably neat &amp; clean and I always knew where everything was.  Overall, it wasn't completely terrible.

I was playing around with graphics settings tonight, as I only have 256 MB video card on my laptop.

However, when I turned Shaders to Low, I could go all the way up to Ultra on everything else and still get 40-50 FPS.

Not right away, but there certainly doesn't appear to be any political will to fix our fiscal problems either.

It may not happen this year, but within the next 2-5 I think it's highly likely and the chance of going 10 years without a collapse is probably next to nil.  

We need short term solutions to bring current spending under control, i.e., we need to run a surplus so that we can pay off our debt.  And, long term, we need to reduce expected liabilities so that we don't saddle our children with unmanageable expenses that they didn't incur.","1272686533"

"technology","t5_2qh16","Correction: Every *other* version.

Every other version is intentionally crap so that when the version after comes out people will think it's a godsend.

95, ME, Vista:  Absolute garbage.

98, XP, 7:  Usable.

See the pattern?

Why?  Because Microsoft makes money on licenses.

Say you're an OEM and you have a contract with Microsoft to provide their OS on your computers.  Microsoft says you have to buy a license for whatever version of Windows is current for every machine you sell, regardless of whether the customer wants that OS.

So they release Vista, which is a pile of shit, and your customers demand you replace it with XP before shipping the machine.  Bam, Microsoft just sold two licenses for Windows:  One for Vista, which you're required to buy and the other for XP, which your customer demands you replace it with.

Did you notice how Microsoft threatened to end support for XP and stop selling licenses, and then they *extended* the period during which you could buy licenses for XP?

That's because they knew that if they said they were going to stop selling licenses, OEMs would buy up as many as they could afford in order to keep selling machines to customers who insisted on having XP rather than Vista.  Why would you slam the door in the face of a customer who wanted nothing more than to buy your outdated but usable product?","1272686585"

Truth be told I'm planning on designing a front-end for a basic, academic game-designing environment that teaches kids about how programming works (well at least object-oriented languages, anyway) that looks a lot like Game Maker. If you did a quick search about it being available for Linux you'll find a compiler called ENIGMA which takes a reverse-engineered version of GML, a simplified language with a lenient syntax system, and converts it to SDL/OpenGL games (is that the n00b's programming library, too, or something?) that are also (supposedly) cross-platform.

I don't what it is with you being stuck-up about Qt, bro (u mad?); if it seems like I'm doing this the easy way, *you're damn right, dude!* But Qt also covers a lot more Operating System support than I really can with Shell scripts and the like. Sure it's probably easier to set up, but I'm not investing in an easy setup, I'm investing in an easy development and multitude of ports.

tl;dr: I wanna make Game Maker for Linux, Qt does more OSs and is easier to work with than set up, plus I've got sweet books on how to work with it, and *that was a pretty nifty investment, really.*

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","At 240 pounds with no previous exercise history, you're running way too fast to be able to maintain any kind of time running. Start slow, work your way up to a comfortable jog, for 5 minutes, then rest (slow to a walk, don't stop) one minute, then another 5, rest, until you finish for the day. 15-20 minutes should be your goal. Once you feel you can go 10 minutes without stopping, work from there.

As for time of day, bodybuilders run before they eat breakfast in the morning, while the body is still drawing on your fats for energy after not eating for a while. 

I'd recommend joining a gym. Lifting weights burns a shit ton of calories, and promotes muscle growth (or prevents your body from catabolizing the muscle you already have, which is very, very bad) which stimulates your metabolism. 

And remember, exercise is only 30% of the equation. The rest is diet.

Stuff to keep in mind:

* No fried shit.

* No non-diet soda. Keep the diet soda to a minimum. Water's better.

* GRILLED CHICKEN.

* No processed meats. (Sausage, pepperoni, bologna, hot dogs, etc.)

* No white breads, no white pasta.

* Salads are great. Cream/soybean oil based dressings are not. Get a lite Italian or vinaigrette.

* Learn to love grapefruit.

* Avoid beef and pork. Chicken and fish are your friends. Also, lots of beans.

* Beer intake kept to a minimum.

* No eating after 7:00 at night. ESPECIALLY NO CARBS.

Your diet should be about 1600-1800 Calories. Another important thing is your macronutrient ratios. There are four macronutrients.

* Carbs. 4 Calories per gram. (Divided into complex carbs, like oatmeal and potatos, and simple, like sugars and white breads. Rule of thumb is complex = good, simple = bad.

* Protein. 4 Calories per gram.

* Fats. 9 Calories per gram. (There are also divisions in here. Eat monounsaturated fats, if any. Olive oil, and the fats in fish are a good example.)

* Alcohol. 7 Calories per gram.

Your daily Calorie intake should optimally be 40% protein, 45% carbs, and 15% fats. This is difficult to measure, but it's important. Eating 1600 Calories of Twinkies will get you nowhere.

Also, as for water intake, one gallon a day, every day. It's daunting, but it keeps you from being hungry, and kicks up your metabolism and your muscle growth.

And the best advice I can give you:

**Weight loss is a marathon, not a sprint.**

Work hard, expect heavy weight loss in the beginning (most of which is water weight), then it will steady out to 2 pounds per week. 

Time to work hard and kick ass.","1272686814"

For the cannery jobs just Google it.  It is pretty hellish and grueling work.  Knife goes in guts come out 10 hours a day six days a week.  I would imagine working hard on a farm and working hard in a cannery are two different things.  The only reward you get at the cannery is a paycheck but it is a big one.  It has been well over 15 years since I did it though and I couldn't give you any great details.

You can really fill tons of time just getting out into the world. 

Even if you only have six hours, you could go on quite the cool adventure. I recommend a 'daypack' that you keep in your car. Grab a change of clothes, some non-perishable tasty snacks, a couple bottles of water, toiletries, spare cash, etc.

If you live in the USA you have access to some amazing parks. My area has county, state, and federal parks all within a two hour drive. You can go to the same park many times and experience new things that you have never seen before, nature can be amazing no matter how sober you are :)

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","It would have been nice to know your ""profession"" as this would help tailor the advice I would give.

But coming from a guy who has fired his boss 7 times for various reasons, here are some thoughts:

Some ""specialties"" lend themselves to freelancing and self-employment. For example, as a computer technician, everyone has a computer so the hardest part is picking a niche (home, business, instruction, malware, networking, cabling) and pushing it. This is a great way to grow as an individual and as a professional.

Looking for a unique way to find employment? Visit the Chamber of Commerce meetings in the area, see if there is a Toastmasters club in your area and start going, look up Lions Club, visit churches if you are religious. The idea isn't to go out and start screaming ""I'm unemployed, give der jerb!"" The idea is to advertise that you are an independent, self-employed person doing whatever your specialty is and meeting people. You will, in a lot of cases, meet existing business owners (or the veritable friends of friends) who you can cozy up to, explain that this self-employment thing isn't working out and you're thinking of moving back into a more traditional job and are ready to do good work for someone who will reward you. This, in the past, has resulted in actual subcontractor work being sent my way and just this week turning into a cool part-time job for extra cash.

I would also say that you want to start thinking about your profession as separate from your business once you get over this temporary unemployment hurdle you are putting yourself into voluntarily. What do I mean? I mean, having the elements in place for a softer landing next time. For instance, after some income begins coming in from your next ""gig"" as we'll call it, start a business on the side. Buy some real estate. Start playing the market (as that is all it really is anyway). If you can put together an income producing vehicle in your life that begins operating outside of your professional income and time, you can begin feeding it extra cash from your professional income to grow it into the ""backup plan"". Then, if you need to fire another boss, it's there. If you never need it, it will be in place for your version of retirement. Passive things like renting real estate, vending machine operation, partner ownership in a local business, insurance overrrides/residuals...the possibilities are endless if you are creative.

I wish you all the best. It sounds like you are making the right decision. 2 weeks sound like they will be quite intolerable in this instance, but you need to decide.","1272686943"

If you're a red blooded male, you know you're clicking that NSFW link on reddit's front page *first*, unless there is the vague warning of something disgusting, or wieners or something.  Maybe you see an IAMA for a pr0n actress, or a swinger, something.  

I never had the problem that you have, but I know that probably 70% of the time I decided to &lt;insert euphamism here&gt;, it was in response to unintentionally seeing something erotic while surfing non-adult sites (such as reddit/fark.com), or watching non-adult TV/DVD, and getting the idea for a ""break"" from something hot that comes up, putting your mind on that path. 

Take yourself out of those situations as much as possible by recognizing where/when you've had that happen in the past.  Go to reddit preferences and check the ""under 18"" box to block some of the adult stuff.  Avoid sites that mix in titillating pics/stories with the news/entertainment you usually browse there for. 

In such a hyper sexualized society - at least one the web and in media/advertising, it's going to be impossible to completely avoid erotic imagery or discussion.  Granted.  Still, by avoiding places you know you've run into material that's caused you to drop trou, you better your chances of being able to occupy yourself doing something else.  

This is not meant to be the idea that cures you - definitely listen to the other advice in the thread.  But it's akin to a smoker resolving only to smoke outside (as I did).  Didn't make me quit smoking, but made me cut way down. 
After all, this isn't smoking, or crack.  Totally quitting doesn't have to be a goal.  It's more like you're overeating, and need to get down to a normal diet.

Everyone's pick for the '60s is going to be The Beatles. That's fine. Whatevs. Can't be denied. I go more for The Kinks or The Byrds or The Zombies personally.

If the OP hadn't limited this to bands (an oversight, I think), I'd say Bob Dylan for '60s as both my personal and cultural pick. That's if we included solo artists.

'70s: Zeppelin is a great choice. Pink Floyd is just as good. Just as good as those two is The Who. I'll go with The Who culturally. Steely Dan is a great cult pick. My personal pick is probably Rush.

'80s: The Pixies and The Smiths were incredibly important. So were R.E.M. and Sonic Youth. But U2 is my personal pick. Public Enemy is my cultural pick. 

'90s: Green Day and Pearl Jam were extremely important. Smashing Pumpkins, Nine Inch Nails too. Nirvana, Soundgarden and Alice in Chains fits for the first half of the '90s but not the second half, so that puts them out of the running in my view. Radiohead are a solid pick for both the '90s and '00s. I'd say Red Hot Chili Peppers were ridiculously important for the '90s though. My cultural vote goes to RHCP. Personal vote goes to Fugazi.

'00s: Where to even start? Coldplay's a solid pick, so is Radiohead. White Stripes, yeah. I'd submit Wilco as a serious candidate. Arcade Fire and The Flaming Lips, too. My cultural pick is Radiohead. Personal pick would be Sigur Ros.    ","1272686996"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Stop drinking soda and eating processed (ready made) food. It's simple, just stop. Also, if you aren't hungry stop eating seconds for the fun of it. Give yourself some time to digest your food after your meal and then decide if you are actually still hungry and need more food or whether you just want more food for the sake of eating. 

Start eating breakfast in the morning. It doesn't have to be anything that requires any work. You can boil eggs ahead of time for the week and have those and some toast in the morning for breakfast. That will take 5 minutes tops.

Start eating more often but in small portions. Imagine what you would normally eat and break that up into several small meals that you can eat throughout the day. 

Start drinking more water, at least a few pints a day. it's easy to keep a bottle of water with you and refill it as needed

You don't have to start running for exercise yet. Start out walking. Make an effort to walk more wherever you go. You don't really need to drive everywhere that you go, it's just more convenient. If you try to start off running you are going to push yourself too hard and get burnt out. Step it up from time to time when you feel comfortable with your level of activity. ","1272687055"

I thought ""well, I guess I have to at least be honest with myself"", so I said it out loud: ""I don't believe in God"".

It didn't change anything about my actual beliefs, but it completely changed how I understood myself.

That was like a thunderbolt, which kind of suprised me at the time, my skin quivered and I felt a wave of sensation pass down my body from top to toes. Then, quickly after, I felt like a dam had burst inside me, as if I'd been holding myself in for years.

With that experience, network. Buy 3 people coffee every week and try to find avenues of work. Bust your ass to not miss deadlines and they'll come back to you.

But to get the experience you need to jump into an ad agency or into newspaper/magazine writing. 

You can also try trade magazines. Go to a library and find the section where they have ""Laser Monthly"" and ""Baker's Quarterly"" -- I just made those up. Find larger ones and ask them if you can pitch stories. Read some good articles on how to pitch a story; however, with trades you can usually handle the work with no experience.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Well, there are a couple of things I can say.

&gt; I almost always skip breakfast.

Hopefully not in an attempt to eat less. They say that breakfast is a part of a healthy lifestyle; if you want to eat less, you should be eating less at each meal, not less often.

&gt; Starting now, I am going to try and just get half of what I would normally get to start with and not get seconds.

Don't push yourself! This sounds like you're going to try to eat about a quarter of what you're used to eating. Don't eat so little that you feel bad; feeling bad does not lead to progress.

&gt; I honestly have no idea how to pace myself and any suggestions are welcome.

Well, how do you feel about the running that you did? If you're loathing the idea of doing it next time, back down, and do less; feeling bad does not lead to progress. If it felt good, great! The next time you want to go running, just imagine those good feelings again, and it will motivate you. (I think. If it doesn't, tell me; I'd be interested in hearing.)

If you're feeling neutral about doing something--you don't feel bad about it, but you don't feel good about it, either--then there's a simple process you can use to motivate yourself. Imagine what it would be like to be done. Keep imagining until you have some *physical* reaction: you smile, or say ""ahh"", or something. (Don't fake it.) Compare your imagination to what you actually see in front of you; keep comparing until the motivation comes.

You use the term ""fat ass"" to describe yourself. You may just be laughing at yourself, but if you're not... like I said, feeling bad doesn't lead to progress. If you feel bad about how obese you are, then you will associate those bad feelings with exercise, and so your brain will make you avoid exercise. (Sucks, I know.) Find a way to eliminate those bad feelings; they need to be replaced with *good* feelings about what the *results* of exercise are.","1272687144"

"pittsburgh","t5_2qhrn","It's a bummer as a fan because what can you do?

All they care about is selling tickets.  It's a game of ""damned if you do, damned if you dont.""

I was 11 years old back in '92 and I remember watching that NLCS game.  It broke my heart.  I used to love baseball when I was a kid, but since then my love, just like the competitiveness of the Pittsburgh Pirates, has waned.  (I believe there is probably a correlation between one and the other.) Now I'm 28 and I've only, just in the past couple of years, started paying attention to baseball again.  Mainly because for $15 you can get out of the house, have a beer, and watch a baseball game at a beautiful ball field.  

I guess *I* don't mind so much that they lose a lot, but it would be nice if, by the time my kid gets old enough to enjoy baseball (wife is pregnant), that I can take them to see a game played by a home team that they aren't embarrassed to be fans of.

"AnimalRights","t5_2qhtg","There are chinchilla rescue groups.

Edit - 

I used to breed fancy chinchillas.  Mostly mosaics, with color variations of them (sapphires, violets, beige, ebony, etc).  I still have my breeder cages, and can probably house about 60 of them on pretty short notice.

But I am afraid that I am too far from NY to take any of them.  But if you guys can find a way to get them to me, I can do adoptions of them, making sure that whoever gets them is at least well versed in proper care of them.

Sidenote - to anyone getting a chinchilla, do **not** feed them the mazuri.  Every time I have tried to switch to the mazuri, I have lost about 5-6 chins when I got to the point that I was feeding 2/3 mazuri and 1/3 their regular feed.  In talking to other breeders, everyone who ever tried to go to the mazuri ended up having huge herd losses.  And we are talking about people who knew what they were doing.  We aren't talking about people who has only had one or two for pets.  And when I change to a new feed, I start off feeding 1/3 the new stuff, and then I go to half old - half new, and then 2/3 new, 1/3 old.  So it is a gradual transition over a few weeks.

The actual cause of (feed related) death in all of mine was hypothermia, due to not eating the mazuri.  Their body didn't have the fuel it needed to regulate its own body temperature.

If someone up there was interested in trying to adopt them out from where they were at, I would be happy to help with a care sheet, and even an interview process.  Biggest things is that they understand that chinchillas need to be picked up by the base of their tails - their little ribs are delicate, and if you pick them up by their bodies, they will end up with things like punctured lungs.  They need to be kept cool, to feed them things like basic rabbit chow, and to give them no more than 2 raisins a day or they will get sick.  They need constant access to dust for bathing, and they absolutely can not get wet.  Their fur is so thick that they will develop a fungus before they dry out.  You can not keep them on wire bottomed cages, or they will break their legs and once that happens, you need to get that leg amputated; if you don't have it amputated, they will chew their own leg off.  They pass two types of stool, one is especially for eating again - that is where they get their digestive flora from.  There are all sorts of other things, too, but these are the biggest things.

Second edit - chinchillas don't travel very far (unless you fly them) very well.  They tend to get constipated, and in a chin - that can be a cause of death.  They stress to death quite easily.  Something to think about as you think about moving them from where they are.","1272687199"

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","Nono, okay this is a MAJOR misunderstanding that is apparently not clearly explained. First off: you can pay off your loan AT ANY POINT IN TIME. You can literally pay the whole thing back the day after you receive your money. There are essentially ""phases"" of your student loan. As long as you are in school (and NSLSC is aware of this with proper documentation - you can't just go to class and expect them to magically know, you have to inform them) you're in ""non-repayment"" status. No interest is accruing on your account, and you're not required to make payments. Then comes the ""grace period"" which is 6 months from the date NSLSC has on file of you finishing class. Now you're probably going ""yeah but I have 4 month summers, am I on my grace period then?"". Yes. So you go to class for 8 months, finish say April 30th, and 6 months from that date your grace period is over. But you go back to school in September and let us know, so we put you back in to non-repayment. The interest calculated during your grace period is a little complicated. (gonna jump ahead for a sec here for good reason, after your grace period you enter repayment status). Interest DOES accrue during your grace period, HOWEVER, if you return to school WITHIN the 6 month period, that grace period interest is wiped clean. If you go to class for a year however, and then take a year off, that grace period interest will be consolidated on to your loan the first day after 6 months is up. Even if you go back to school after a year, you're past your 6 month grace period, and that interest is added. Basically, once you enter repayment, the grace period interest is permanent. So lets re-cap so far: Non-repayment (no interest, no payments), Grace period (6 months, Yes interest but it's wiped clean if you go back to school WITHIN the 6 months, and payments are NOT required during this time). Finally comes repayment status. You get papers just before your grace period is up telling you what your monthly payments will be like, and NSLSC AUTOMATICALLY BEGINS DEDUCTING THAT VALUE FROM THE LAST BANK ACCOUNT THEY HAVE ON FILE. No this is not illegal, and yes you DID grant NSLSC permission to do so when you signed your loan, it was in the fine print. Okay so lots of info and I didn't answer your whole question yet. So as I said you can pay off as much of your loan at ANY point in time. Now here's the big mistake everybody makes, and that is waiting until they're in repayment. When you're in repayment you're required to make payments monthly, the reason for this is because interest is adding up, and it needs to be cleared every month. A good chunk of your payment is JUST going to interest. If you make payments while you're in non-repayment status (no interest accruing) or during your grace period, EVERY PENNY YOU PAY will go DIRECTLY to your principal (amount you owe) and NONE to interest. Another mistake people make is not making lump-sum payments (more than what you owe per month). The interest is compounded monthly, so your regular payment WILL clear the interest for the month, so ANYTHING you pay on top of that goes DIRECTLY to your principal. Phew, lots of typing. Hope that was helpful, sorry there's so much info but there's a lot to cover, and you asked a very important question ;)","1272687231"

"WTF","t5_2qh61","Fantastic comment.  Absolutely true - heaping praise on people constantly encourages a sense of complacency.  This is happening in the UK where students have suffered (yes suffered) from grade inflation.  Now it's common for students to get straight As.  What happens? They have a natural sense of entitlement now.  That's perfectly normal and human.  If I had straight As, I'd feel like the world is going to be my oyster. Thing is - they're not equipped for the real world of hard work, using your initiative and getting on with things when the going is tough.  

How many times do you hear of successful people this kind of story: they started out as a loser in life - friendless, bullied, ugly, whatever.  But they pulled themselves up by the bootstraps and built something from nothing. 

Nothing stings more than losing, or being told you can't make it.  While many might take it to heart and ""believe it"", IMHO many more use that as a spur to prove people wrong. 

Not saying we should call young people losers and prod them with sticks, but definitely don't do the opposite either and tell them they're brilliant and that life is there for the taking.  No, life is NOT there for the taking.  Life is hard, and you have to work hard to succeed.  If you work hard and are determined, life is there for the taking.  ","1272687259"

So, I am a completely different person when I am with my brother compared with when I am with my friends. It doesn't mean that I'm not being ""myself"", it just shows that there are many different sides to me. We are shaped by what society expects of us. At school, I'm quite a shy person, and I have trouble talking to people that I don't know, but I have never had any trouble joining new sports teams and meeting new people. I am a very insecure person, and I was shit scared that I would be joining a sports team and not knowing anyone there. I realised that it didn't matter what I did, some people will like me and others will not, so why bother trying to satisfy everyone?

What I can say is this: I don't know exactly who I am. However, I am always trying new things, and finding out more about who, and what, I *can* be. Don't ever do something that feels completely at odds with what you already know about yourself. Try to push your boundaries a bit and find out more about your personality. If you are hanging out with people and outright lying about who you are/what you like, then they probably are not the right friends for you.

You definitely want large 'NO SMOKING' signs around the pool, though.

If there was an inexpensive process for obtaining oxygen, it would slash the use of vast amounts of chlorine, which is a nasty pollutant.  

A critical point is that a potentially dangerous part of oxygen production, compressing the gas, could be avoided by just using the pools own water flow, with the Bernoulli effect, to get the oxygen to the bottom.","1272687369"

Honestly, I'd suggest trying to watch some gay porn and seeing how it effects you.

First problem. Sounds like she's not that into you

&gt;I took her back because I want to start a family.

Second problem. You are in it for the wrong reasons

&gt;She doesn't like sex but I've never had anyone else complain about me before.

Third problem. Conflicting interests. 

&gt;but that's kind of all she's got going for her.

Fourth problem. You don't seem that into **her**

&gt;Should I leave even though I've got a kid with her? 

Yes. There is always a change that you can both get over your differences as friends, but the relationship is doomed. End it respectfully and let her know that you are going to do whatever it takes to take care of your kid.

Background: I haven't used a check-cashing place for 20+ years -- until yesterday. I'm self-employed and had a check from a client that I wanted to cash without my bank's standard hold period. It took four places (When it's not a payroll check, people get nervous!) before I found one that would handle the check; the fee was 5%, or $130 on a $2600 check.

I know the fees on payroll checks are lower, but none of them looked in the 2% range. Oh, and here's some fun: By law in my state, they have to post the APR on the payday loans and title loans they offer -- I saw rates ranging from 391% to 599%.

"reddit.com","t5_6","&gt;Not to mention, he said ""Ugh, cue conservative backlash and ""I told you so's,"" regardless of how illogical that reaction is."" In other words, he's bitching about something no one has even said yet.

Yes, I am. Do you think those reactions will not come? I sincerely hope they won't, and if they don't I will eat my humble pie happily. 

&gt;The guy who replied to him made the point that liberals do it just as often, and he says the liberal in question is a comedian, so it's cool.

Wrong. He didn't say that ""liberals do it just as often,"" he targeted a single, specific instance that was an inaccurate comparison. If he had said ""liberals do it often,"" I would have agreed with him, because many of us do. Want to hear something funny? I have no problem with conservative ""I told you so's"" if they are deserving.  However, in the case of the bill and crime, they aren't, and I laid out the reasons why that is the case.

&gt;but his rationale that because someone occasionally mixes in a joke in with their political ideology, doesn't make them less of a pundit, and less responsible for what they say, than say a Hannity.

You have a valid point there. I will add, though, that the main reason I played the 'comedy card' was on the grounds that he was not holding all of those people ""personally responsible"" for the spill, which was what the person who replied to me claimed.

&gt;It's funny to see him resort to name-calling ""you are a partisan pinhead"" when he is accusing ""conservatives"" of being bad for something they haven't even fucking said, just something he ""cues"" them to say, 

My original post was a commentary on the eventual backlash that will result. As I said, I hope I'm wrong, but you yourself say I'll probably be right, at least to an extent. I don't see how you can agree with my conclusion, then turn around and criticize me for it at the same time. As for name calling, yes, I did. ""Partisan"" because the person's name is ""laughatliberals,"" and he clearly lives up to it, and ""pinhead"" because he was accusing me of hypocrisy when I never made any claims outside of these two specific cases. Maybe I was out of line with the name calling there, but I still think it's accurate.

&gt;and then goes on to make excuses for liberals who do the exact same thing. ""Oh he said it on twitter, or he used to do stand-up in the 80's.""

I did not make any excuses. I was comparing a single instance that somebody tried shoving down my throat. In the case of Maher, what he suggested made sense, regardless of whether or not you agree with his stance. More drilling should statistically lead to more spills and more damage, and pointing out the consequences of that is not unreasonable. I was not saying that he did not say ""I told you so"". In fact, I said the explicit opposite.

I'm guessing you'll skim over my post, pick out the words that fit your conceived definition of me, and feel a sense of self-validation. I hope I'm wrong here, too. Either way, you are reframing my points and the context of them (and by context, I mean without reference to the people I was replying to in the first place) in a way that makes it look like I am saying things that I really am not. Also, nice job on the passive-aggressive criticism by replying to someone else's post fishing for agreement. You want to criticize me? By all means, feel free to do so, but talking about me in the third person does not make you any more right.

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","I think your system is perfectly credible and meaningful. *However*, if you were to rigorously posit what you describe as ""doing your best to reduce suffering"" in the world as the ""good""--in definitional terms--then you'd succumb to just such absurdities. The failure of consequentialist ethical models is that their justification is in the future. What might seem successful in the near-term (famine relief) may cause mass starvation in the long term. Thus, the temporal dimension of teleological ethics is *always* a problem. In the parlance of philosophy, single-case models of probability cannot be axiomatized, established by frequency statistics, or expressed in Laplacian or Bayesian terms (for the reason that there are no input data or prior probabilities) but consist only of the measure of confidence with which a claim is given. This is not a position of epistemic fortitude. An example of this moral ambiguity is the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. If these cities were not bombed would many more people have died in a subsequent land war? Nobody knows--the alternative is a corpus of counterfactual suppositions that cannot be meaningfully compared to veridical history. 

On the other hand, deontological ethics--based on virtue, say--have problems of their own. The Catholic church considers mass starvation to be a morally palatable alternative to contraception. It is concerned with obeisance to its laws; not the results thereof. Hitchens's trenchant condemnation of such moral criminality is compellingly outlined in his book *The Missionary Position*.

Of course, there *is* room in the middle, and your position is laudatory; I wished only to expose some of the pitfalls of taking this approach to its tempting logical ends. Peter Singer, whose ideas I find charitable and honorable, nevertheless bit this bullet, and his case, whatever its merits, is thus logically specious.

&gt;But at the same time, you have to keep in mind that generalized IQ is...of questionable usefulness anyway.

Actually, general intelligence is the best predictor of job performance for most jobs.  And looking at specific types of intelligence usually doesn't account for much additional variance.

&gt;If you have a person who scores extremely high on one part, and extremely low on another, you already have a score that's skewed.

There are exceptions, but it's rare to see someone score very high on one test (e.g., a math test) and very low on another (e.g., a verbal test).  Cognitive ability tests tend to correlate with one another.

Some seminal articles on the subject:

* *The validity and utility of selection methods in personnel psychology: Practical and theoretical implications of 85 years of research findings* by Schmidt and Hunter (1998).

* *Predicting job performance: Not much more than g* by Ree et al. (1994).","1272687456"

As romantic as this sounds, you'd be surprised what happens to you when you're subject to the elements and nature. Water is the highest priority, a single day without water will degrade your mental agility, and all you will think of is any source of water you can find. In the event that you're unable to find clean water, your mind will begin to look for anything with H20. 

After a day or two without food, your mind is really poorly able to do anything right. Hunting is out of the question if you have no experience in this already. You're sole source of nutrition must be vegetation, and you won't survive long on that without advanced knowledge of what is edible and what isn't.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","This is what is working for me:

No specific diet or exersice routine is going to change you. There is only one magic bullet that is going to help you... and that is that you have to decide on a long term lifestyle change.  It is a decision and daily choices that help that decision.

1.  Go for a walk several times a week.  Bring your wife or daughter.

2.  Pack your lunches and make somewhat healthy decisions on what you pack.  Eat several smaller meals throughout the day.  I eat a health bar or healthy cereal before work, usually oatmeal &amp; nuts/raisins @10, sandwich and veggie ( fat free dressing) @noon, veggie and fruit at 3 and then a decent supper.  Eating like this will make you feel full throughout the day.  I have counted calories/fat, but do not now.  This has helped me figure out the general healthiness of stuff.

3.  Eat fish (not fried) 2 times a week with veggies for supper.  The rest of the time... make good decisions, but don't kill yourself.  Order a pizza every once in a while.

4.  Run/jog or go to the gym.  For running... do what you can do.  first, try and get to .5 mile or 1 mile.  get on an elliptical one day, run the next. set goals and work for them.

5.  Limit soda... even diet.  it makes you fat.

6.  Find food that is acceptable substitutes.  For me, I know that some foods just cannot taste the same unless I make it the 'fat' way, but I have found that for most things most of the time, I can find acceptable substitutes.  Sure, I still make the fat versions on occasion, but very rarely.  I use lean turkey burger in spag. sauce and barely know the difference.  I use eggplant for 'the meat' in chili I make.  half n half instead of cream.  FF skim milk instead of 2%.

These are all small things that I do to support the decision I made 2 years ago to stop living the way I was.  I am far from perfect on my diet, but I have kept 30 lbs off for the past few years and still losing.  In a few weeks I am running a 10 k.  My cholestorol has dropped 30 points.  I feel better.

My ex-wife is from there (she wasn't ex at the time) and we were living in Houston. One day I was driving around and figured I needed a hair cut. I see a place down the street and stop. I walk in and there are only black people there.

They are all staring at me and this big black lady walks up to me.

""Can I help you?"" she asks .. kind of coldly.

""Yeah I'd like to get a hair cut please."" I respond.

She gives me a weird look and takes me over to her chair. I try to make a bit of small talk.

She then stops and looks at me. ""Y'all ain't from around here are ya?""

""No, I'm from Canada.""

Well ... suddenly her entire mood changed. BIG smile. Joking around.

I went back there every time I needed a hair cut. And every time I walked in she would come running and give me a big hug. ""My boo is back!"" she would say.

One time she was really busy so she asked if it was ok if the new girl cut my hair. I said sure.

Now, keep in mind I have short straight hair.

Every now and then she would look over and yell at the new girl.

""What the hell you doing? You jacking my boy up!""

I kept wondering how you could ""jack up"" my hair. She yelled at her a couple more times before telling her to get out of the way and she finished my hair cut herself.

After going there a few times my wife asked where I was getting my haircut. I told her and she was shocked. Apparently I was going to a rough neighbourhood where white folk don't go. I had to laugh because I never had any problems there.","1272687683"

"WTF","t5_2qh61","The Foxification of WSJ is continuing unfortunately. Murdoch is pissing all over a venerable institution. But check out the only comment on the WSJ story:

""First off all, two questions to the person who printed this story. Do you work for this person who failed to understand Fred's complex yet simple message? No? Are you yourself one of these adults who feels entitled because you may have watched Mr. Rogers yourself as a young one? No? If the answer to either question is no, then where can this professor's sources be varied and how can they be tested?

Truthfully, all people close to the man knew that Mr. Rogers off-screen was the same as he was on-screen. As Mister Rogers, the kindly Fred McFeely Rogers was not merely playing a role. He was Mister Rogers, because his message of accepting people for who they are is a universal human trait most people unfortunately lose as soon as they reach a certain age and become either bitter, cynical, jaded, and shallow or they become as Mister Rogers always had hoped...caring, giving, respectful, and loving persons.

This sense of entitlement that you and this professor speak of comes from those parents who dote on their kids by spoiling them or by caving into the child's wants, instead of giving the kid what they truly need. And what kids need is someone like Mr. Rogers telling them the truth about life whilst also saying that they have something of worth to offer, no matter how much society may place prestige upon wealth and how much success one may have.

The message ""You are special"" is not to give any sense of entitlement, for when Mr. Rogers first incorporated that belief system into his programming, it was an undefined and implied given that people would have to work hard and do all they can to make it in a world that doesn't always cater to them.

These days, as people--young and old--become more lazy, legarthic, dependant on technology, and more about quantity as oppsed to being energetic, exhuberant, embrasive of both traditional and technological sources in the ways each can provide for the world, and more about quality, a humble and almost angelic message of being proud of who you are from a man like Mr. Rogers is often lost admist the hustle and bustle of a faster-pace life.

Family Communications, the company that supported Mister Rogers' Neighborhood in its entire run on public television stations, had this to say on behalf of the world's most beloved television neighbor:

Over the years, millions of our viewers have told us how important Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood has been as they were growing up -- helping them grow into competent, caring, compassionate citizens of the world. Children did not interpret his message to mean they were entitled.

We’re all familiar with Mister Rogers’ signature statement, “You are special” and the way he ended his program saying, “There’s only one person in the whole world exactly like you -- and people can like you just because you’re you.” Why is that message so important to young children -- and how did it help them develop self-control, self-discipline, and a sense of responsibility?

1 ) Why affirmation is such an important part of Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood – and childhood

Let’s not forget that Mister Rogers’ primary audience is preschoolers. Brain research has confirmed what professionals, educators, and child development experts have long known -- that in order to thrive, young children need affirmation. In fact, it’s generally the children who don’t have a solid sense of self-esteem who often grow up to be more narcissistic. Without a loving base, they can’t acquire a strong sense of values, and they can’t see things from other people’s point of view. Particularly at a young age, when children are beginning to develop important life skills, they need to know that they matter in this world. The secure feeling of being loved and valued is the basis for all learning -- in school and in life.

Fred assumed that most of his viewers were hearing that kind of affirmation from their parents. But he also knew that many of his young viewers were missing that secure feeling of being loved, and he knew how to use the power of the medium to deliver life-affirming messages. Time and time again, we have heard from people who grew up in dysfunctional families, those who were abused, had disabilities, or felt different in some other way, that Mister Rogers was the single sustaining force in their lives -- because he was the only one who told them that they were lovable…that they were special.

2) Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood helps children develop self-control

Unconditional love is one of the absolutely essential ingredients in order for a child to develop self-control -- one of the major developmental tasks of childhood. When children are secure in knowing they are loved, they want to control their inner urges so they can please the people who love them. That’s what helps them master the developmental challenges like controlling where they go to the bathroom or controlling their impulses to bite or hit or ignore the rules. For children to master these tasks, they need to have a good feeling about who they are and what they can do – along with a reasonable sense of shame which helps them stay in control. The other essential ingredient for self-control is knowing that rules and limits are part of life, and that is a constant message in the Neighborhood series.

Fred always talked about making rules and setting limits as a part of what loving parents and teachers do. Children, when they know they are loved, want to control their impulses -- and the adults who love them make and enforce rules, limits, boundaries, because they love them.

3) Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood helps children develop persistence

Mastering the developmental tasks of childhood -- and any new learning -- requires hard work and persistence. What helps young children keep on trying, through their mistakes, frustration, and discouragement? Knowing they are valued. Ironically, it’s knowing that they are special -- just for who they are, not for what they might achieve, that keeps young children working at a task that’s hard. There is a great deal of difference between encouragement, which the Neighborhood offers, and gratuitous praise. Genuine encouragement from people who value them enables children to try their best. As Fred said, “One of the best feelings in the world is being proud of what you’ve learned after you’ve worked at it.”

As composer and lyricist, Fred also put that kind of encouragement to music as messages for his young viewers and their parents. One of the premiere advocates for children’s television Peggy Charren called Fred a “singing psychiatrist” because he used his songs to deliver messages that are so important in childhood. University of Maryland professor Ellen Handler Spitz says, “Fred’s work was ALL about children trying hard, trying again and again, learning, improving, understanding, growing. It was NEVER about accepting rudeness and demanding fake praise.”

4) Fred Rogers was the antithesis of instant gratification, entitlement and lack of responsibility

Mister Rogers always hung up his sweater. He always fed the fish. All the guests, from cellist Yo-Yo Ma, children’s author-illustrator Eric Carle, Olympic gold medal basketball star Suzie McConnell -- shared their talents and talked about the hard work and practice it takes to do something well. The puppet stories in the Neighborhood of Make-Believe were not resolved in a half hour -- but over a whole week, after the neighbors worked together to try to solve their problems and took responsibility for their actions.

So of course, Fred’s message of “You are special” was central to his work. Because it’s a message that young children need to hear in order to grow up to be competent, caring, and compassionate adults. As Fred said, “Anyone who has ever been able to sustain good work has had at least one person—and often many—who have believed in him or her. We just don’t get to be competent human beings without a lot of different investments from others.""

So please, look inside yourselves and see that it's people like Mir. Rogers who keep things going, with their good lessons as the counter balance to all the fake and superficial things in the world. After all, doesn't make others feel good about who they are give people a good feeling?""","1272687725"

So yes, that sort of proselytizing is generally internally consistent. Of course, the idiots in that video obviously didn't care a whit about anyone, and simply wanted to make a public display of taking offense at allowing a clergyman of another faith open their meeting. We *are* a Christian nation after all... ಠ_ಠ

An anecdote:  Burning Man, if you haven't heard of it, is a huge festival in the desert...it's pretty free and lawless...your average Southern Baptist's head would spin if they saw what goes on. On the road leading into the gates last year, a Christian group handed out free gallons of water (an absolute must for desert camping) with little cards calling Christ the ""Living Water"". My friends were offended that they were trying to proselytize, but I thought it was a cute gimmick. If you're interested in their message, you could read attached material, if not...hey, free water!

"movies","t5_2qh3s","Number one is because I own a projector, surround sound, and a optical player (until a month ago, it was DVD, now it’s blu-ray).  

As to *why* I own a projector: 

#1. Cinema ticket prices. Movies are too expensive for 2 people. $30 for 2 people, vs $3 for a ""recent movie"" DVD rental. 

#2. I hate the hype. After years of Star Wars prequels, Pirates of the Caribbean sequels, Matrix sequels, Spider-Man 3, all movies can be safely assumed to suck, unless proven otherwise. 

Distributors like to hype movies as “must see this summer”… etc. From my POV there’s no reason for me to watch *Kick-Ass, Iron Man 2, Date Night* in cinemas: it’s not a live event. Instead, I watched *Get Smart* on Blu-Ray, which I really enjoyed. 

I had great experiences with Avatar &amp; District 9 in a cinema. But I’ve had many many more “thank goodness I didn’t pay for *that* in a cinema” moments than “I wish I had seen this in a cinema” (*Pirates of the Caribbean 1*). 


#3. Uncertainty about cinema quality. 
It used to be that I could tell Cinema A had a big screen, good sound etc. 

*Now*, because cinemas are multiplexes, I can’t be sure whether a movie *at a certain time* will be in Hall 1 (good), Hall 2 (best), or Hall 8 (small). e.g. a 6pm showing may be great, but a 7pm showing may be 
less great. Same movie, same price. 

#4. **Most** of recent movie experience has been good. But *sometimes* people are real dicks. There was a time (around the time of War of the Worlds/Tom Cruise) when it was impossible to go to the cinema because of kids/phones/talking/laughing (inappropriately), but I feel it’s improved since then. Possibly related to higher ticket prices. 

#5. Because I no longer follow the cinema listings in newspapers. 
Now, I easily miss movies I’m keen on in the cinema. e.g. I only just realised that “The Road” had already shown in cinemas. Oh. I’ll just wait for the DVD/Blu-Ray release. 

#6. Because I’m not sure why I would want to watch sex scenes/disturbing scenes in public. e.g. I’m not sure whether to watch *Funny Games* or *AntiChrist*. But I certainly wasn’t not going to watch those movies in a cinema. 

I’m mid-30s. Used to be that if you wanted to watch a movie the way a director wanted you to, you **had** to watch it in a cinema. e.g. Terminator 2. The alternative was VHS (bleagh), laserdisc (pricey) on a TV (small/pan-scan vs smaller/letterbox). Blockbuster movies used to stay in cinemas for *months and months*. 

IMO, DVD and larger home screens (TV/projector) killed cinema box-office returns. Why should I watch [latest loud summer movie] when I can watch or rewatch [old loud summer movie] again, and then watch [latest summer movie] later on DVD? You could never have done that with VHS.

Firstly, a BA in any liberal arts program is relatively useless if you want a set of immediate practical skills like you might get in an engineering program. I don't see how a English or history major has so many more career opportunities than I do. What you get out of your lib arts degree is broader skills. Employers can assume you have a certain degree of writing skills or time management skills. You need to be somewhat organized to get through most university programs. You gain a alternative approach to problem solving because you learn to adopt a different set of mind.
This is were I think philosophy is particularly unique because it is a whole degree about thinking and examining truth. You learn to approach any argument or project from a critical stance which distills dimensions into a more logical language which is free from rhetoric. 
Applied education provides you with solutions to specific frames or circumstances whereas philosophy provides you with the tools to approach any frame you may encounter.","1272687813"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Thanks for the suggestions. It's kind of an odd situation. The problem is more so that I need to sell the house because the mortgage payments are killing me. We got really, really lucky getting a buyer (house was only on the market 3 days).

I know that the price of a washer and dryer are negligible when compared to the mortgage payments and the sale price of the house. I get that. The problem I have is that the washer and dryer were never for sale. The buyer put them in the offer. I'm so afraid to delay this sale by even a week that I just gave in and signed it. I talked to my realtor about it, and he talked me out of it (voice of reason, really.)

All in all, it doesn't really matter. I just really wanted the washer and dryer. They're not a particularly good set. They were a gift to us from my mother in law when we were too broke to afford our own. Giving them up just sucks.

I just wondered if I could take the microwave since it wasn't in the contract. It's technically not a part of the oven/range. It's a separate thing all together, albeit it IS a range hood, though not part of the range.

Anyway maybe it's a stupid question. I am just still pissed off that they snuck the washer and dryer in the offer, and I felt so trapped in selling this house I was too afraid to counter it.

My fault I guess. Just wondered what options I might have. Thanks for your voice of reason too. I'll leave the issue as it stands. Fuck the buyer for putting the washer and dryer in the contract.","1272687874"

""Can you please justify why another LEO would side on the victim who can't defend himself? This is in ref to the first story. I'd also like to bring up a local story. A Leo fired a taser from his moving patrol car while chasing a teen on a bicycle. When the teen was struck by the taser he seized up(common when shot with 50k volts) falling off the bicycle and was then run over by the same officer. Are you at all suggesting this officer was defending his life by not having a heart attack chasing the kid on foot? What justification can you give that? Not all police are corrupt/bad but some are and when they are they should be held to the fullest extent of the law.

Edit:This teen was caught trying to steal copper from a construction site. He wasn't a killer, drug dealer, rapist, etc. He posed no immediate threat to the LEO worst case he gets away. But he would/could have lived. As I recall this LEO wasn't reprimanded because at the time the policy for taser didn't CLEARLY state not to shot from a moving vehicle. I would say common sense should prevail but he works for the government so that's not an option here.

My dorm friends and I are still close and fondly remember the ridiculous nights of adventure.  That first year I kept my job at home.  It was the wrong choice because I stayed at home most weekends and missed a lot.  It's easier to get involved and engaged when you don't leave the college bubble too often.

My perspective: Imagine that instead of ""sexual orientation"", we're discussing ""favourite colour"". Look how silly things get. ""You SAY your favourite colour is blue, but I don't know, man. You've got a LOT of green stuff. Maybe you've got two favourites. Or you're just not being honest with yourself. Look, I know better than you. I can tell. Your favourite colour is totally green.""

See what I'm getting at? Fuck you if you wanna tell me who I am. If a guy says he's straight, that's good enough for me. He's straight. I don't care if he sucks dicks or has sex with guys. I've had sex with straight guys before. It's FINE. It happens. You may have trouble meeting people of your gender for sexual relationships if you're openly heterosexual, but that's your choice to make. Not mine.  ","1272688152"

"politics","t5_2cneq","Have you heard of Japan and Italy's problems of an aging population? Well just like us their main population doesn't produce as much children anymore like back in the old days, while the older folks are living a lot longer now. Unlike us their deportation and border immigration agencies work really well so both of those countries are quickly becoming large retirement homes, since they dont' have enough immigration (legal is just too small) to fill in the void. Japan's solution to make up for it is with robots. I guess they haven't watched any of the Terminator movies yet.

All I know is that our industries need cheap labor, and I (and probably most Americans) have no interest in our kids growing up to pick fruit. Moreover our military needs more soldiers, both present and future. If border patrol and ICE were actually successful it would be disastrous. If we lose cheap factory labor, what do you propose as the alternative? Losing and moving even more factories to China, or... Mexico (we won WWII mainly from our industrial output you know - for every Panzer we made like 20 Shermans)? State enforced protectionism and even more welfare handouts to business? What about our exports? As for cheap food production labor, say goodbye to food just costing about 5-10% of a family's income. It'll probably rise up to at least 33%, like it was in the past. What's your solution for that?

If this was anything new, what I'd have to say is just conjecture, but every major ethnic group that has ever immigrated to the US over time eventually assimilates to American culture and language, and contributes to both US industry and the US military; and like the way the Mexicans are being treated now, back then people hated on the Irish, Germans, Italians, Chinese, Japanese, and even Jewish immigrants. Probably the only known exception to this is the city of Miami (which may turn into the US version of Quebec one day).

I'd say one thing we can do to improve the situation is to have the US gov make English the one and only official language of the US, for all gov institutions","1272688225"

I don't advise that, assuming you want to survive. Technology is great. I don't like the phrase 'catching food', I prefer killing an animal, harvesting it, cooking it, and consuming it to survive. 'Catching food' just degrades the whole process of where 'food' comes from, it's mostly muscle off of a dead animal. Oddly enough, hunting has made me more of a vegetarian... mostly for health reasons though. Red meat isn't really all that healthy.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","My story will probably get lost in the sea of comments already here—but it really boils my blood, and I'm going to tell it.

Like most people, I try to avoid Walmart and other similar evils.  **But I'd never actively *boycotted* anything until last winter.**

There's a little grocery store not too far from where I work.  Hole-in-the-wall type place, lots of overpriced crap and very slim selections when it comes to fresh produce and the like.  But, it's nearby and therefore convenient.  I used to stop in every once in a while to grab something on my way home.

So, it was February 8th, 2009, and I had a craving for some Brie cheese and crackers.  I stopped in the grocery store to see if they had any Brie, and after a loop of the refrigerator sections, I found some!  

It looked a little. . . *weird*, but I'd never bought Brie before (only had it at parties and the like), and thought maybe it was just the way the rind was supposed to look.  Besides, I checked the ""Sell By"" date, and it was still two weeks away!  I bought it.

On the busride home, still craving cheese, I got to thinking that I'd taste *just a little bit* and save the rest for when I got back to the dorm.  I dug the package out of my backpack, and started having second thoughts about my purchase.  No longer under the fluorescent lights of the store, it was really looking dodgy.  *Man, this looks like it might be spoiled.  Maybe—nah, I'll just open and smell it.  How bad can it be?*

The plastic wrap was held in place by the sticker label, so my first step in opening the vile thing was to remove the label.  As I was peeling it away, I noticed something odd:  there were *two* labels, one on top of the other.  The lower one had been mostly peeled away, but one corner remained—the corner proclaiming that the original sell-by date of my cheese wedge was *over a fucking month ago*.

I did not open my cheese wedge on the bus.  [I did, however, take pictures to document it.](http://imgur.com/MhQuc ""The fuckers even raised the price after it went bad.  Fuckers."")  

Out of a terribly masochistic sense of curiousity, I *did* open it when I got back to the dorm.  It was, bar none, the worst thing I have ever smelled.  As soon as the protective layer of plastic was breached, rotten cheese slime leaked out with a stench that could have killed small animals.  If I'd eaten anything earlier that day, I would have vomited, and *the smell would have been an improvement*.  As it was, it just left me dry heaving while doubled over the nearest garbage can.

After I recovered and was willing to brave the room once again, I held my breath, triple-wrapped the awful thing in plastic bags, buried it at the bottom of the garbage, sprayed the kitchenette with Febreeze, and prayed that nobody would ask questions.

So yeah, that's my story.  I still work right by the place, and it's still incredibly convenient.  But I will never shop there again.  

Fuckers.","1272688335"

"politics","t5_2cneq","It's possible.  There was a thing a while back about the newborn ""Trig"" being a borrowed baby for the photo ops.  The theory said that the ears of the newborn as seen in the pictures, and the ears of an older Trig during the GOP convention were clearly not the same ears, hence the babies were not the same person.

The theory goes on something like this:  Bristol was pregnant, so they hid it, corresponding to a time she was not seen in school for months.  They were going to give the baby up for adoption or something... Anyway, the baby was born somewhere in February 2008.  When born, they found it had Downs.  The baby was needing A LOT of health care, which Bristol and her boyfriend could not afford, so it was quickly decided that Sarah would pretend to be pregnant for just a a few weeks, and claim the baby as hers, since no one knew Bristol had a baby, and Sarah's fat Governor's benefits would cover the baby.  But, the baby was growing fast, as babies do, so they could not show off a two month old as a newborn.  However, they happened to know someone who was pregnant and due soon!  The perfect ""stunt baby"" to parade around for photos.  When that woman gave birth, Sarah gets the news while in Texas, and lo and behold, her ""water broke"" and she made the 10-hour flight back to Alaska while ""in labor.""  In the days after that baby was born, pictures were taken of Sarah and the newborn.

But, goddammit, Bristol and her boyfriend can't stop screwing and about this time, she gets pregnant again.  Sarah says ""fuck it, I can't pretend to be pregnant AGAIN!""  Plus, she's starting to become a national figure so, they are just going to have to admit it.  So, in December, Tripp is born.  

So yes, there is a theory out there that both kids are the babies of Bristol.

Lift weights. I guarantee you that if you cut out sugar/soda, eat regular meals, and start lifting weights, you will start losing weight.

"Favors","t5_2re6a","Combination of Photoshop and Painter. It was nothing fancy, just a quick and dirty job, mostly automated.

Here's how:

Photoshop to correct the perspective (handheld cameras tend to distort vertical lines, so they diverge or converge at the top, depending on photographers's position).

Painter: basically did an autopaint with a clone brush, using 3-4 layers each with a different sized brush. Masked the layers inwards, keeping the biggest (and roughest) brushes at the periphery, and finer brushes towards the center to get details of the bridge and boat. Sort of the same principle as drawing the eye in towards some center of interest, only in a painterly rather than photographic fashion. Rough layers use random brush stroking, finer layers use directional stroking, keying off contrast changes in the image (edge detection).

About 10 minutes to do the whole thing.","1272688409"

And, as a result, both are contracting in a manner that's likely more prolonged and less efficient that it would have been otherwise.

For the racing industry, legislative help came in the form of many states' casino regulations. As more and more states have authorized casinos, several have carve-outs to funnel revenue to the racing industry. Another approach: In some markets, racing facilities have sole or preferred rights to introducing casino-style gambling in the market.","1272688425"

I've met the whole crew a couple of times at their season premiere parties (which were open to all).  Great times.  All were very friendly, chatty, and sociable (except for Jean Paul Tremblay (Julien), who kept his distance from the public in a VIP section; maybe he was having an off night or something).

I used to run into them now and then around town, and would compliment them on their show.  I knew they were probably sick of it, but I couldn't help but show my admiration.

BTW: King of Donair.  Life changing experience, don't miss it.  

(And don't do it regularly, or it will be *very* life changing, and give you that heart attack you've been waiting for.)

I miss the show a lot.  (The movies were okay, and the series started to stray a bit in the last season or so, IMHO.)  I guess it's good they exited before milking it too much.

There's *so* many classic scenes it's hard to pick what the best ones were.  

Although having [Rita MacNeil](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rita_MacNeil) and the [Men of the Deeps](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Men_of_the_Deeps) kidnapped and forced to pick marijuana plants while singing [Working Man](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THDit8fRgtY) (a coal mining song, ""it's a working man, I am . . .""), is pretty hard to top.  

Oh, a [clip](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THDit8fRgtY).

Buy the DVD's, support their work.

(Even if you're not into that style of music, [Working Man](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LesfYqwqvYo\)) sung by Rita and a choir of real coal miners is pretty touching.  I don't think I'll ever complain about my job again.

Cops do have the right to talk to you and ask questions just like anybody else. You don't have to answer. However, just them talking to you can be considered a detention in the right circumstances. See *[R v Grant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R._v._Grant)*. *Grant* recognized the situation of a psychological detention. Even though you are not physically detained or arrested, when talking to the police if a reasonable person would think they have no choice but to comply this would be considered a detention.

To search you, the Police the need the same grounds as to arrest (detention), which is reasonable and probable cause. See *[R v Juan](http://www.canlii.org/eliisa/highlight.do?text=R+v+Juan&amp;language=en&amp;searchTitle=Search+all+CanLII+Databases&amp;path=/en/bc/bcca/doc/2007/2007bcca351/2007bcca351.html)*

However that being said, they can do an investigative detention and search. This has to be done on an Articulable reasonable suspension (lower standard than R&amp;P cause). The investigative detention should be brief in duration and does not impose an obligation on the detained individual to answer questions posed by the police. A search incidental to the investigative detention can go no further than reasonable necessary to ensure the officers safety. Basically they can give you a pat down, but cant just reach in your pocket. Pat down to search for weapons, can't go looking for evidence. However, if they feel something that feels like a gun in the pat down, that might give them reasonable and probable cause to do the full search. See *[R v Mann](http://www.canlii.org/eliisa/highlight.do?text=r+v+mann&amp;language=en&amp;searchTitle=Search+all+CanLII+Databases&amp;path=/en/ca/scc/doc/2004/2004scc52/2004scc52.html)*

As for asking for ID or your name. Previously *R v Moore* (1978) held you needed to identify yourself to a police officer less risk being charged with obstruction of justice. *R. v. Guthrie* (1982) basically held you can only be charged with obstruction of justice for not identifying yourself if the Police have reasonable and probable grounds to arrest you. However, this is a pre-*Charter* case, and I am do lazy to do the research and not sure if *Guthrie* would now hold true post *Charter*. 

Post 1982 we have a constitutional guarantee to the right of silence rather than only the common law guarantee.

EDIT: Grammar and formatting. Also my apologies for no link to the *Moore* and *Guthrie* decision. Could only find those cases on Westlaw and Lexus, couldn't find a free version to link to online.

EDIT 2: Also important to note. In the US, it is my understanding (any US lawyers/law students feel free to correct me here), that you have the posion tree/poison fruit doctrine. ie. Any constitutional violation will automatically exclude the evidence. In Canada, this is not the case. If your *Charter* rights are violated, it does not automatically mean the evidence will be excluded at trial per s. 24(2). The Courts will do a *Grant* analysis to decide whether or not to exclude the evidence. See [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R._v._Grant) for a good summary. ","1272688477"

"politics","t5_2cneq","It really has nothing to do with ideology so much as just better management. 

Dems can be more easily trusted with large projects because they are less likely to be highly corrupt. The spending shows that, Dems have fiscal responsibility on their side. 

Sooo if you are going to invest in border security or even military the best time is under Dem control. Sadly then the political pendulum will eventually swing back to the GOP and they'll invent a war or deregulate mega corporations even more and crash the economy again.

When the nation was run by strong dems through the 30s to 70s we did great, even with higher taxes on the rich and community rated non profit health care. We went to the moon, we invented computers, we pioneered civil rights and technology on every level. 

Since the GOP has regained power in the 70s and 80s, then 2000, we have gone straight into debt and expanded government and military at record levels. 

Personally I think border security is a decent buy vs inventing wars every 10 years and spending trillions. Our borders are fairly vulnerable if there was a true organized terrorist threat. However coastal waters, not Mexico are probably the most vulnerable. I think a unmanned fleet of border control drones isn't ridiculous or incredible unnecessary like for instance invading Iraq. It's probably not necessary and most of these problems are better handled through diplomacy and ending imperialistic practices. However it's just easier to believe the Dems will use them properly while the GOP will be secretly spying on everyone. 

I think it should be fairly accepted that at some point we'll have real time monitoring of the whole nation from space or low orbit. Like real time google maps, if the military can do that, they will and drones are kind of expensive but unmanned vehicles are definitely the wave of future military tech. Inventing a few reasons to keep pushing the technology forward isn't the worst idea we've had. Fighting mexican mafia should be pretty high up on our list of things to do and if the US does make a move to crack down on organized crime extra agents and drones will be very useful. 

I don't think full drug legalization is coming anytime soon, so border security is good for deterring gangs and as cheap counter terrorist efforts. 

It's also smart that our immigration policy is one where we reject criminals and the highly destitute and aim for only giving citizenship to those who meet our screening criteria. Like.. having an education of some sort. Also with the push for immigration reform, which is key to the Dems keeping seats in congress you'll want to beef up border security. This gives you leverage in a way by saying we'll secure our border, BUT we need to offer working illegals who've made a home here a chance to get legal without being hassled. Politics and manipulating the masses is just like dealing with woman.. you slap them with one hand while caressing them with the other. :P ","1272688651"
"sex","t5_2qh3p","Oh geez, do a little research before you post stuff, please. 

Up until the 20th century, women were not even full legal citizens of any Western country. They could not own property, and even if they could get a job, any wages they earned belonged to their husband. An unwed mother was hidden in various ways (grandmothers raised the babies as their own) or shunned, sent to Homes for Unwed Mothers - sanitariums - where they would have the baby and it often became a ward of the state.
They were financially dependent on their fathers, then their husbands. And if a woman (read: girl) was not married by a certain age, around 18 although it varied, she was considered an old maid and not eligible or desirable. And she lived off of her parents for the rest of her life. Or became a school teacher.... we all know that stereotype, right?

If this scenario seems ludicrous to you, that just shows the success of the feminist movement, which was pretty much hijacked by the Boomers to be about sex, when it had already existed for 150 years or so and was much more about civil rights and finances.

But, if you want to know where the stereotype of the lustless woman comes from, it stems from the ideal of virginity and chastity, so a man knows his children are really his. Women have been painted this way and their urges have been stigmatized because all of civilization has pretty much depended on men being able to pass down their property. This is why monogamy exists, and this is why women have been trained for millennia to stifle their urges. Being horny is simply ingrained in them as unfeminine, as ironic as that is.

Sorry for the rant.... you just seemed to need informed. But I do agree that financially things are much more even these days. The sexual revolution seems to have come soon after that was made law.","1272688652"

In 1948 there were 950,000 Palestinians in the territory that became Israel. After Israel declared independence 700,000 left. Israel says because the Arab leaders ordered them to and the Arabs say that Israel drove them out. I tend to believe Israel because 156,000 Palestinians stayed in their homes and became Israeli citizens. Their descendants now make up 20% of Israel's 7.5 million population. That's right there are more Palestinian citizens of Israel than existed in 1948. It is inconsistent that Israel drove out 700,000 and then turn around and grant citizenship to 156,000 in a place that clearly had a capacity for millions. If the Palestinians had not left in a huff to mount war against their hated enemy then there is ample evidence that they could have stayed and become Israeli citizens.  ","1272688678"

I had put it in the submission box the day before. Then the lecturer said he thought he'd lost my paper and asked if I could email him another copy - I said I would, not mentioning the late submission.

This left me with a problem. I was off the hook for the lateness, but only if I could break into the submission box somehow and retrieve the paper, which had a date on it three days after the due date. This proved more difficult than I thought. I spent about an hour wandering around the university and going back to the box in order to test various methods of getting the paper out, but nothing worked. To make things worse I had to make sure no-one was in the corridor while I did this (it was outside the main faculty office).

Finally I went to the uni bookshop and bought a ruler and some tape. I wrapped the tape sticky side out around the end of the ruler, inserted it into the submission box and pulled the paper out. Success!

tl;dr: I was in the same situation as the OP except I had already submitted the late paper and the lecturer didn't know. I successfully MacGyvered the paper out of a box in order to hide the evidence. ","1272688724"

It sounds like your focus has been in HR and Training. Kind of a tough call, but I think my formula, if run alongside other obvious things (resume blast, job sites), could help you.

You will always have people in your life who don't bring it any good (much like this boss you are dealing with). While I won't dismiss his abilities to rain fire on your professional life since I don't have enough information, experience has shown me that these people are more bark than bite. Focus your energies on calling on existing relationships (professors, alumni, peers, Facebook friends, your parents) and building new relationships to advertising your availability to any group/organization/company who might be lucky enough to have you.

Let me just add too that out of the 7 places I have worked, I am still good friends with 6 out of 8 of the owners/bosses/managers I have worked with (I could literally research for 5 minutes to find out their current numbers, pick up the phone and have a great conversation with any of them...probably pull a job opportunity out of at least one of them).

Alcohol prohibition ended once and for all on a national scale (which is what I suggested) in less than one year.  This is not the same scenario.

Edit: 48/50 states if Oregon successfully legalizes. ","1272688775"
"reddit.com","t5_6","As I understand it, there are possibilities for more efficient cars and in particular with some high tech and we might have those now, or sooner, if we hadn't spent the last 40 years allowing the oil and auto companies successfully lobbying to stop the gov't from investing in that research or any mandates for smaller lighter vehicles (Dems for autos and GOP for oil) or a surcharge on oil or even building mass transit.   After all, newer cars get much higher MPG then the old ones did.

The fact that people can be easily convinced to buy the biggest gas guzzler is not exactly what I would call a convincing argument.  How many years did we waste while we had a ""oil is cheap drive whatever the fuck you want"" mentality which led to people driving heavy overly powerful fuel inefficient cars?  (which ironically helped destroy Detroit; no such luck with the oil companies) Surely, we could have increased fuel efficiency much earlier but R&amp;D and mandates for lighter frames and smaller cars.   
We subsidize the oil companies for billions and we could have been a much much more efficient country then we are now.  

Maybe you think this makes me some crazed socialist that I think the gov't should play a strong role in reigning in the impulse if individuals to have big cars with cheap oil at the incredibly large expense of the environment,  Global Warming, but I make no apologies.   If the gov't isn't capable of legislating to prevent a catastrophe then what's it good for?  Oil is a lot of ways is easy (if you're not fighting wars for it) but it has hidden costs the world can't afford.

BTW, that 100 year supply of Oil you reference, as per the oddly highly circulates snopes story,[ is not exactly uncontested](http://jacksonville.com/news/metro/2010-03-07/story/fact_check_is_the_bakken_formation_americas_oil_bonanza).   In fact, it smells like an awful amount of wishful thinking if not B.S.

But, for the sake of argument, let's imagine for a minute that we do it your way; that we 'drill baby drill"" and this oil reserve pans out and for the next 100 years and pull out a butt load of oil.  I imagine, given our ignominious history on this, that we would:

1) Pollute the shit out of our air, water, and land

2) Global Warming - note that the biggest purveyors of the ""Global warming is a hoax"" meme has been the oil companies and their paid scientists and they've done a fabulous job and bribing republicans into doing everything they can NOT to deal with it (or even admit it exists).  As always with this kind of industry selfish BS, they also do a wonderful job with disinformation PR to the general public. 

Note that the cost of the damage oil had done in this regard is in the trillions and will only grow.  Some of the damage it will do is simply beyond imagination (as whole areas and some countries become submerged in a rising sea level over the next 100 years not to mention crop failures etc)

3) And ensure that gas is real cheap ensuring that we, as always, don't lift a finger to try and switch off of oil which is inherently problematic (point 1).  We'll continue, as per the oil company lobbies, to drive big gas guzzlers because ""why the fuck not"".  I believe the phrase really bad companies use in such a situation is ""freedom"". (like when Phillip Morris was pushing back against tobacco regulation by going on the road with the U.S. Constitution).  There's this bizarre idea that as American we should be free to drive whatever the fuck we want regardless of the damage it causes.

All in all, oil is a disaster and increasingly so going into the future.  If I take for the sake of argument that we have 100 years of it in the U.S. it's still a disaster.  Note that of course even if we do have this oil and extract it we'll sell it all over the world and all the emerging countries might take the same short sighted attitude and drive polluting cars en masse.  Super.     That increased oil demand will then burn through the oil even faster and multiply the pollution and global warming problem many fold. 

Oil is a dirty finite resource.  We should invest heavily to move away from it as quickly as possible.  Maybe there's no free lunch but there's a better one out there then the incredibly expensive shit sandwich you seem to be shilling.

"science","t5_mouw","The genes for skin color are not linked to intelligence to my knowledge. However, her hypothesis is based on the notion that members of different racial groups are often more closely related to each other than members of different races. This is thanks to minimal mixing of genes between these groups before the age of exploration.  No real geneticist or evolutionary biologist will argue this.  When applied to animals, its how we use genomes to tell the evolutionary history of different groups.  For example people of northern european ancestry not only tend to carry genes for lighter pigmentation, but they also carry the genes for cystic fibrosis at far higher levels than any other race.  Likewise, sickle cell anemia's genes have much higher prevalences in people of african descent.   Both of these have supposed evolutionary advantages for carriers of these disease.  Carriers are people who have one gene but not the other.  Since we get one copy of each chromosome from each parent, recessive diseases like those can be covered up by the one working gene.  But I digress.  Really though, it is by no means racist to say that people of different races have genetic predispositions than other races.  However, I doubt that there is any strong science to back up her claims that people of African descent have a genetic disposition towards lower intelligence.  ","1272688815"

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","The steps for recollection that I'm aware of are as follows. You're in normal repayment and you're in the clear, you deal with normal CSRs. You fall one payment behind then you're handed off to Tricura, which is NSLSC's in-house collections department (where I worked). Once your loan is OVER 9 payments behind, then your file is handed off to a 3rd party collections agency. Once you're dealing with them your file can NOT go back to good standing, and you're through dealing with the NSLSC. These guys are in a way more forgiving as long as you're trying to work with them, but you have less repayment options (interest relief, debt reduction, etc...)... in fact, you have NO options. You repay, whether it takes you 5 weeks or 500, you pay. This is all I'm technically aware of, however I did hear stories of special delinquents where the government actually starts docking from your paycheques. Officially I have no confirmation of this to be honest, because Tricura doesn't interact with the 3rd party collectors. Bottom line is this is taxpayer money, and if you're trying to avoid paying it back, if you're refusing to cooperate, they'll fuck your shit up big time. They have your SIN, they have info on your bank accounts, and you've signed many legally binding contracts, so in a court they have the upper hand. Just cooperate, if not with Tricura, than with the 3rd party collectors. (Just remembered this note) Tricura has VERY specific guidelines they have to follow as per their contract with the government, so they can only accommodate your situation so much. The 3rd party collectors don't work the same way, so your minimum payments may HAVE to be X with Tricura, but with the 3rd party guys you can negotiate it to be Y.","1272688827"

I think a lot of straight porn studios just find any old nasty guy, as long as he's got a hefty cock, to do it because their target audience doesn't care and might even appreciate that an ugly guy can get a ""hot"" porn chick (makes them think they have a shot).

Anyway, I think porn is a really subjective thing and one can like a work of pornography for a lot of different reasons that are hard to decipher to someone else merely viewing that work. Maybe you like the guy's grunts. Maybe he shoots a big load. Maybe you just want to pretend to be the woman or something.

I think the deal is that, if it's the case that you are not ""100% straight"" (who is?) and are open about it at least to yourself, then in my book you are welcome to describe yourself as gay. I think it is also worth exploring what you want in terms of your ideal kind of partner. Is it a guy or a girl, or is either fine?

"reddit.com","t5_6","Re the use of the comma:  I am referring to the ususal rules of style (Chicago Manual of Style, etc), which would have had me use semi-colons between the various aspects of Bill's repertoire if I were to use a comma to separate ""gay"" and ""gun lover"" while keeping them related to one another.  I guess the issue is whether or not these two things should have been kept together rather than listed as separate things (in which case commas would have sufficed), but I chose to keep them together in juxtaposition (of stereotype, as I have said).

I agree that Burroughs clearly found that the traditional limits of the novel -- which separated it from other forms of expression whether literary, spoken, sung, or beaten out with one's fists -- were moribund and that that sensibility informed all of his work, whether it be written fiction, spoken fiction, or written or spoken fact, all of which were to him (and are, in my opinion) aritifical constructs.  

I would say that he tended to combine (sometimes with boundaries maintained, sometimes with them having been swept away) all of these formerly significant categories.  

That combination was most potent for me in his spoken words, especially where they referred to a text he'd written, where the usual linguistic parameters of punctuation could be augmented by elements of the spoken word, like emphasis, tone, gesture, and so on.  

All of these formerly distinct elements were blended in what he spoke in a way that could not realistically be done in a written form.  And, as I've said, they were puncated by the power of his particular form of speech and the very sound of his voice.  

Was the written word over?  I agree that he believed it probably was (at least as an optimal form of expression it was exhausted from the time of being Here to Go), but he still addressed it, even if in a de minimus form, by cutting up the physically recorded words he and others had written.  (By the way, I have an original copy of Here to Go, which I treasure, but he did this elsewhere and never stopped doing it, as I am sure you know).  

Cutting up written text was a way of dealing with its limits, but it also acknowledged its extant and continuing thrall over our storytelling.  If it had been utterly irrelevant, then perhaps he would just have ignored it altogether.

Re his comments on television, personality, etc., yes, this was a topic of his and he clearly knew that ""fame for fame's sake"" was incipient throughout the time he did his most important writing.  

At the same time, he vounteered for fame (repeatedly, and with various waves of success, through the 50s, 60s,70s, and 80s).  So he was intelligently critical about the phenomenon, but he also repeatedly thrust himself into the middle of it, and his relationship to celbrity has to be viewed through both of these lenses.  (I am not disagreeing with you, or at least not on purpose, though you might ultimately decide that we're at odds, I am just elaborating a little from what you said.)

To introduce one other element into the conversation, I would be very interested to hear what you think about his relation to JG Ballard, who in many ways was (I think) his counterpart from the 80s onward.  

I'm not sure that there was any other person whose work impinged as much on Burroughs' from his own perspective and to which he reacted as much.  Am I off the mark here?  Certainly Burroughs thoughts on celebrity eventually were integrated in the public mind into a larger whole that included Ballard, who was occasionally fixated on fame (his writing on Reagan, for instance).

To me it seems that in the 80s Burroughs and Ballard, along with others (Genesis P Orridge and the folks at REsearch, Jim Carroll, and others) formed the first matrix into which Burroughs could locate himself since the time of the beats.  Do you think I'm astray here?  I'm curious.

"reddit.com","t5_6","No, shame on you for being a reflexive know-it-all who operates on what amounts to false certainty. 

While (in my opinion) the majority of officers are honest and competent, there exists a sub-set in every major department who are essentially sociopaths with guns, badges and the power of arrest, which they abuse on a fairly regular basis.

I don't presume to know what prompted the responses from the officers in these two cases, and neither do you. Blind, uncritical support is a bad idea in general, a worse one when it comes to people who have the ability to ruin your life if they're so inclined.

Is every story about police abuse of powers false? 

The bottom line is you can reflexively defend any police action blindly, without knowing the material facts, that is your personal choice. However, you come off as the mirror opposite of the people who make baseless statements pronouncing all enforcement officers as evil and corrupt. 

If you want to live in a black and white world that consists only of absolute right and wrong, that's fine with me. However, in the real world I inhabit the police can and do make mistakes, engage in highly suspect behavior, suborn and misuse the law, and take advantage of essentially innocent people for reasons only known to them.

If your experience is different that's fine, however, everything I mentioned unfortunately goes on, often on a daily basis, in far too many police departments across the country. 

The brush you're choosing to slather everyone who disagrees with you is no different from the one used by the people who falsely accuse all police of being corrupt, you're no better than they are, not in the least.","1272688986"
"gaming","t5_2qh03","I've played through part of the first one.  That bit where you're crawling under the floorboards, and you *know* there are giant spiders in there, then you *see* one scurry across another tunnel.

I explored the rest of the tunnel *very* carefully, constantly looking over my shoulder.

Took me a while to realize that it was gone.  The quick glimpse was only there to make you paranoid -- you actually can't find the spider anywhere down there, but you sure as hell can *hear* it, and it scares the shit out of you.","1272688988"

"politics","t5_2cneq","rate of suicide for males exceeds that of females by 4:1.

&gt;The crude suicide rate among male and female VHA users was 43.1/100,000 and 10.4/100,000 person-years, respectively; whereas, the crude suicide rate among males and females in the general population was 23.2/100,000 and 5.2/100,000 person-years, respectively.

as shown also in nonveteran statistics, male suicide numbers are much higher than female.
